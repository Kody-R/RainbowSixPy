# Omen of Acheron

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Greece (Athens, Delphi, Crete)** – From shattered amphitheaters to underground oracles, woven through the ruins of forgotten memory

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Omen of Acheron** is not a movement—it is a resurrection.  
A cult of mytho-technologists, rogue classicists, and psywar agents who believe Greece must be reborn by reactivating its **mythological subconscious**.  
They don’t just spread fear.  
They turn cities into stages where ancient tragedy is weaponized.

> “We are the shades between memory and myth.”

Using symbolic attacks, coded rituals, and neural hallucination masks, they fracture reality—summoning old gods into modern conflict.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Omen cells follow the philosophy of **The Re-scripture**—the belief that myths are **weapons encoded in memory**, and that society can be rewritten through reenacted fear.

- **Chorus Speakers** – Public agents who trigger myth cycles in civilians via embedded AR  
- **Cryptomasks** – Field operatives masked as Fates, Furies, and Oracles  
- **Shadelinkers** – Tech shamans who encrypt AI data inside epic poetry and chant

Their rituals follow the structure of Greek tragedies: 5-part attacks unfolding like scenes, with final acts erupting in psychological collapse.
