# Echo Khronos

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Kazakhstan** – Deep within the ruins of an abandoned Soviet cosmodrome and surrounding comms facilities near the Baikonur Exclusion Zone

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Echo Khronos** is a clandestine cadre of **Cold War engineers, radio officers, and uplink technocrats** who never surrendered to time.  
Born from the fallout of the Soviet Union, they maintained hidden listening posts and uplink silos in secrecy — awaiting a signal that never came.

> “We never disarmed. We just waited.”

Now reawakened by modern AI fragments and geo-political instability, Echo Khronos hacks satellites, reprograms drones, and resurrects forgotten orbital weapon systems in defiance of terrestrial control.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The group believes in **Temporal Sovereignty** — the idea that true power lies in controlling the rhythm of the world via orbital comms, kinetic timing strikes, and blacked-out global visibility.

- **Khron Agents** – Long-haul communications experts running analog and digital signal routing  
- **Pulsewrights** – Technicians trained in satellite ping manipulation and relay hacking  
- **Clockbound** – Foot soldiers and drone pilots whose tactics are synchronized to algorithmic war-chronometers

These units answer to a council called **The Relic Loop**, a cabal of legacy officers preserved via signal echo and mnemonic proxies.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Echo Khronos deploys **precision-guided disruption** backed by a backbone of dormant Cold War infrastructure.

- **Primary Terrain:** Bunker networks, frozen launch pads, relay fields  
- **Style:** Drone-and-jammer warfare, uplink sabotage, localized blackout ops  
- **Presence:** Abandoned cosmodrome rings, antenna forests, subterranean radar bunkers  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Hijack regional satellites to disrupt ops**  
  - **Trigger cascading GPS blackouts and false target pings**  
  - **Launch decommissioned Soviet-era drones with updated targeting AI**  
  - **Use decoy orbital signatures to mislead operator tracking**

> You don’t see Echo Khronos coming.  
> You just stop seeing everything else.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
Their emblem is a **Soviet satellite dish fractured by a temporal glyph**, radiating outward like a frozen echo.  
It represents silence that outlived its sender.

> **The past never ended. It looped.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Rust Red** `#9E1B1B` – Deteriorated war relics, enduring ideology  
- **Cold Steel** `#4A5D6A` – Obsolete alloys, military gray logic  
- **Radar Green** `#A3FFB5` – Comms interception, uplink targeting

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Echo Khronos’s strength lies not in brute force, but in **temporal advantage and orbital control**.

- **Induces signal loss across entire sectors**  
- **Compromises drones and optic gear mid-mission**  
- **Launches EMP mines using Cold War subsystems**  
- **Field teams operate without digital trace or heat signature**

> Engaging Echo Khronos is like fighting a ghost that speaks in static.  
> **And answers with fire from the sky.**
