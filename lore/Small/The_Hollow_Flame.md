# The Hollow Flame

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Iran (Dasht-e Kavir Desert, Yazd ruins, Persepolis site zones)** – Operates from buried shrines, ash-marked ruins, and sun-scorched watchtowers across the desert

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Hollow Flame** are no longer keepers of light.  
They are **embers of a forsaken prophecy**, a desert cult that once sought purification but now walks a path of scorched retribution.

> “Faith burned too long becomes cinder.”

Bound by oaths etched in obsidian tablets and mirage-marked sand, they transform **ancient ruins into tactical fire zones**, harnessing the wind, heat, and celestial alignments to wage entropy warfare.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Litany of Ash**, a doctrine stating the world’s purity can only be restored through flame and memory erasure.

- **Ashwardens** – Fire-channeling zealots with ruin-forged relics and ember-choked breathers  
- **Miragecallers** – Heat-warping scouts who distort vision with desert optics  
- **Script-Bearers** – Glyph-taggers who use Zoroastrian sigils to mask traps and blind drones

Rituals are synced to lunar phases and solar eclipses—each attack a liturgical act.
