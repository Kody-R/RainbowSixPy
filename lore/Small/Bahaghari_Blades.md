# Bahaghari Blades

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Philippines (Visayas & Mindanao Archipelago)** – Hidden island docks, typhoon-hardened villages, and coral smugglers’ paths

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Bahaghari Blades** are the sea’s shadow.  
Pirates, tech-riggers, and ex-militia turned storm-saboteurs, they use the chaos of the Philippine archipelago and its monsoon season to launch swift, precise raids on trade lanes and naval assets.

> “Rain hides everything. Especially the knife.”

They claim no allegiance to any nation—only the weather. And when they strike, their blade is wrapped in cloud.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Blades operate under the principle of **Storm Harmony** — treating meteorology as both tactic and religion.

- **Tidecutters** – Amphibious infiltrators using weather pulses to mask movement  
- **Windmancers** – Former meteorological analysts turned data jammers  
- **Blade Hosts** – Sea raiders who embed explosive ordnance in coral canoes or wreckage islands

Their units coordinate via encrypted storm forecasts and sonar bursts, slipping between islets before satellites ever catch them.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Bahaghari Blades dominate archipelago terrain using **weather-informed raids and signal confusion**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Island coves, monsoon ports, coral caverns  
- **Style:** Hit-and-vanish, ambush-withdrawal, radar disruption  
- **Presence:** Weather-beaten fishing towns, smuggler tunnels, derelict ocean platforms  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Deploy floating mines that mimic storm debris**  
  - **Jam enemy signals using solar flare reflection sails**  
  - **Trigger typhoon-front lightning strikes to cover extractions**  
  - **Use sail drones disguised as fishing kites for uplink theft**

> The sea listens to them.  
> And it answers in ruin.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **storm wave curling around a blade**, dripping with rain and coral ink.  
It mocks Rainbow’s name while cloaking itself in typhoon-born fury.

> **The rainbow doesn’t shine in storms.  
> That’s where we do.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Bahaghari Blades use **hydro-terrain to vanish, isolate, and cut without trace**.

- **Floating EMP nets triggered by tidal pressure**  
- **Drone cloaks made of typhoon-sourced heat patterns**  
- **Multi-island escape relays using sea-cave waypoints**  
- **Diversion units generate false radar echoes**

> You won’t know they were there—until your tech drowns and your ship bleeds.
