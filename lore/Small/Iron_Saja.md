# The Iron Saja

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**South Korea (Gyeonggi Province, Incheon ruins, Seoul fringe districts)** – Mountain temples laced with fiber-optics, surveillance-shadowed alleys, and smoke-filled drone parks

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Iron Saja** walk between circuitry and spirit.  
Masked in tradition, coded in chaos—they are techno-shamanic insurgents seeking to restore Korea's ancestral soul.

> “The lion of death wears metal now.”

Once artists, monks, and system engineers, they now don **digitized Hahoe masks**, weaponizing spiritual rituals through encrypted warfare.  
Their war is not against the state—it’s against forgetting.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Scroll of Resonance**, a living scripture that teaches control of light, code, and echo to **summon memory through disruption**.

- **Bellcallers** – Urban prophets who trigger EMPs through harmonized temple tones  
- **Maskbearers** – Parkour-trained attackers with mirrored-face drones  
- **Charmbreakers** – Cyber-shamans who fuse firewall breaches with spirit-channeling rituals

All rituals are synced to the lunar calendar—attacks often fall on festival days cloaked in symbolism.
