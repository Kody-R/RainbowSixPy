# Red Dust Confederacy

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Post-Collapse Wastelands** – Dominant across irradiated deserts, crumbling mountain passes, and scorched battlefields of the old world

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Red Dust Confederacy** is not a government — it is a **survival engine**, built from rust, ruin, and revenge.

Once scattered bands of **warlords**, **deserters**, and **tribal survivors**, they have now united under a single creed:  
**"Dust is Dominion."**

In their world, there is no law.  
Only the strong rule.  
And the dust remembers all who fall.

> Their armor is scavenged.  
> Their technology is broken, reworked, and deadly.  
> Their banners are burned — but still rise.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Confederacy follows no central doctrine — only the rule of the **strongest voice** in the dust.  
Yet among the chaos, a shared belief binds them:

- **Dominate what you cannot trade**  
- **Crush what you cannot tame**  
- **Leave only bones and banners behind**

Their leadership is fractured but respected — warlords rule with cult-like devotion in their territories. Key figures include:

- **The Burned King** – A scarred tyrant whose body is fused with melted armor and myth  
- **Gravecallers** – Prophets of ash and fire who weaponize belief and poison  
- **Rustclaw Marauders** – Rapid-response raiders who travel by scrap-stitched bikes and dune haulers

Every unit earns their place in blood and reputation. Their stories are carved into bone or tattooed in dust-ink.
