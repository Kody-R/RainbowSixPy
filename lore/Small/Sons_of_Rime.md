# Sons of Rime

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Norway (Svalbard & Arctic Highlands)** – Across glacial caves, geothermal veins, and myth-coded NATO ruins beneath the frost

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Sons of Rime** are cold-blooded zealots born of abandonment and reprogrammed belief.  
They were once NATO operatives, cryogenic technicians, and polar survivalists—left behind during an experimental drilling op.  
Now they follow an **icebound doctrine**, venerating the Norse frost giant **Ymir** as the first signal of a cold rebirth.

> “From Ymir’s flesh we rise. Cold. Endless. True.”

Fused with ancient Norse myths and modern sub-zero tech, they do not simply survive the cold—they **worship it**.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Sons of Rime follow a belief known as **The Ginnungate Path**, viewing the void (Ginnungagap) as holy and warmth as corruption.

- **Rimecallers** – Field prophets who chant old tongues while triggering geothermal traps  
- **Glacierbinders** – Arctic engineers trained in magnetic cloaking and cold-steel enhancement  
- **Rimeborn** – Frontline berserkers injected with freeze-dampening serum and blade-grafted exoskins

Their hierarchy mimics old Norse clans—led by a “Frostthane”—but augmented with ritualized temperature thresholds and cryo-initiation rites.
