# The Ascendants of Lalibela

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Ethiopia (Lalibela Highlands, Tigray escarpments, Simien church plateaus)** – From stone-hewn monastic ruins to cliffside cloisters wired with untraceable drone tech

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Ascendants of Lalibela** are **drone-monks**, born of faith and forged in altitude.  
They hide beneath sacred robes, chant in jamming pulses, and launch precision craft from within ancient chapels.

> “From the rock, we rise.”

To outsiders, they are relics of a bygone age.  
To those who trespass airspace—they are divine judgment on wings.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their belief, the **Sky Gospel**, teaches that surveillance is sanctified, and height grants revelation.

- **Incense Callers** – Technicians in ceremonial garb who guide drones using heat-bloom trails  
- **Spire Pilgrims** – Operators who launch gliders from monastic rooftops, descending in silence  
- **Sanctum Weavers** – Camouflage architects who shape drone nests into chapel ceilings and cliffside icons

All movements are planned in accordance with the **Lunar Readings**, and drone attacks coincide with liturgical bells.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Ascendants use **altitude camouflage, aerial dominance, and ritual flight patterns**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Monastic rooftops, mountain passes, echo-walled sanctuaries  
- **Style:** Stealth swarms, airpath denial, high-ground ambush  
- **Presence:** Rooftop courtyards, sacred bell towers, fog-veiled launch pads  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Release incense clouds that double as drone scent-masking agents**  
  - **Launch psalm-pattern jammers to confuse Rainbow’s drone controls**  
  - **Deploy prayer scrolls wrapped around remote-trigger EMP rods**  
  - **Hide drone forges in stone baptismal fonts and sacramental vaults**

> You won’t see them coming.  
> **You’ll hear the bell—and then the silence.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **stone church flanked by rising drones**, their wings haloed in gold, their eyes pointed downward.  
It symbolizes reverent surveillance and divine escalation.

> **What flies prays.  
> What prays fights.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Ascendants are **ritualized drone insurgents**, masking tactical superiority in monastic devotion.

- **Jammers triggered by harmonic chants override Rainbow sensor pings**  
- **Gliders may be mistaken for religious kites until weaponized descent**  
- **Operators may hesitate due to cultural targeting hesitation**  
- **Smoke, prayer, and altitude merge to create layered defense fields**

> Rainbow won’t face fire.  
> **They’ll face faith—and a shadow overhead.**
