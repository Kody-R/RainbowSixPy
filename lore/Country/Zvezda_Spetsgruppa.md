# Zvezda Spetsgruppa

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Post-Soviet Territories** – Operates primarily from deep within **Siberia** and **Arctic dead zones**

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
Born from the frostbitten remains of **Cold War black ops**, **Zvezda Spetsgruppa** ("Star Special Group") is a **paramilitary phantom**, composed of **disavowed Spetsnaz**, **rogue scientists**, and **chemical warfare engineers** long thought buried in the snow.

Where others dismantled weapons, **Zvezda preserved them**.  
Where others erased data, **Zvezda encrypted it** in **permafrost vaults**.

> This is not a faction of ideologues —  
> **they are survivalists of a bygone superpower**, refusing to die with it.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Zvezda operates under the doctrine of **"Kholodnyy Zakon"** — *The Cold Law*.  
It emphasizes:

- **Containment**  
- **Denial**  
- **Controlled escalation**  

Their leadership — referred to only as **The Directorate** — is rumored to operate from **subterranean nuclear silos** beneath the **Ural Mountains**, issuing kill-orders via **one-time-pad radio bursts**.

Units are organized into **Cells**, each named after **celestial bodies** and trained in **specific retaliatory protocols**.  
No unit ever sees the full picture, maintaining **operational obscurity** even within their own ranks.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Zvezda Spetsgruppa is **surgical and brutal**, operating in the **silence between geopolitical headlines**.  
Their methods include:

- **Site Protection:** Securing derelict Soviet-era weapon caches, including rumored **psychochemical agents** and **unmapped nuclear warheads**  
- **Icebreaker Sabotage:** Disabling surveillance and Arctic transit routes, including the **Northern Sea Route**  
- **Tech Resurrection:** Reviving decommissioned Soviet technology — from **cold fusion prototypes** to **railgun platforms** — with **modern control systems**  

> They act as **custodians of Cold War sins** — and the enforcers of its resurrection.
