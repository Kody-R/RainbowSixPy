# Consortium Zero

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Nigeria** – From armored extraction convoys in the Niger Delta to fortified mobile refineries in deep coastal rigs and privatized ports

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Consortium Zero** isn’t a corporation—it’s the future of warfare by economic erasure.  
An alliance of **oil executives, rogue AI strategists, and blacksite logistics lords**, it operates behind trade laws, masked by security contracts, and backed by data-driven resource forecasts.

> “Borders are dead. Resources are divine.”

They claim no flag. Only profit—and the firepower to extract it.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Consortium functions like a sovereign supply chain, using predictive logistics and drone-based enforcement to control zones of interest.

- **Resource Overseers** – Enforcers who route kinetic drones through offshore command decks  
- **Refinery Primes** – Operators in charge of refinery-FOB hybrids with onsite security AI  
- **Dividend Executives** – Commanders embedded with cybernetic ledgers, tracking efficiency per kill

Their motto: **"Stability through throughput."**

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Consortium Zero applies **force multipliers**, denial tech, and infrastructure chokeholds.

- **Drone Caravans** – Automated convoys rigged with counterintel turrets  
- **Mobile Refineries** – Shielded resource hubs that double as staging areas  
- **Supply Denial Walls** – Force fields triggered along shipping lanes  
- **Fuel Chain Raids** – Shock assaults timed to exploit Rainbow’s resupply windows

> Their bullets are profit.  
> Their armor is liability denial.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **barcoded globe** veiled behind a black refinery stack, its base dripping crude.  
It signals ownership, not allegiance.

> **You don’t fight them.  
> You negotiate your surrender.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Consortium Zero is a **lethal logistics empire**, fighting with drones, firewalls, and resource dominance.

- **They anticipate ambush with AI predictive routing**  
- **Target Rainbow’s resupply networks first**  
- **Deploy hack-drones disguised as civilian survey bots**  
- **Neutralize resistance by pricing their survival against drone upkeep**

> This is not a war.  
> **It’s a hostile takeover.**
