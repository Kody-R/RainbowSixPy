# Order of the Zenith Gate

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Ethiopia** – From cliffside crypts in the Simien Mountains to sky-grid terminals veiled beneath ancient monastic towers

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Order of the Zenith Gate** worships the sky through signal and steel.  
Formed from a splintered military R&D faction and cloaked in aerial doctrine, they’ve fused **drone supremacy with messianic flight theology**.

> “What soars is sacred.”

Their faith is uplift. Their war is perspective.  
And from altitude, they command both visibility—and fear.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They serve **The Ascension Protocol**—a belief that those who control the upper grid inherit dominion below.

- **Choir Operators** – Drone priests embedded in stone towers, reciting uplink chants to direct swarm behavior  
- **Aether Sentinels** – Glider-drop shock troops who strike from above in silent formation  
- **Halo Architects** – Technologists who camouflage drone forges inside ruined churches and cliff spires

Every deployment is choreographed through **altitude-aligned scripture** encoded in their airframe logic.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Zenith Gate uses **high-altitude denial, vertical drone dominance, and electromagnetic “hymns”** to control battlespace.

- **Dome Shrines** – Relic temples fitted with uplink emitters disguised as sacred crowns  
- **Sky-grid Gates** – Hidden drone ports along cloud passes that unleash automated sentries  
- **Echo Hymns** – Electromagnetic pulse waves disguised as liturgical dronesong  
- **Seraph Lancers** – Strike craft programmed with ramming protocols cloaked as gliders

> They don’t own the battlefield.  
> **They remove it from above.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **burning crown rising from a spread-wing drone**, encased in a gold halo.  
It is the mark of aerial purity and divine surveillance.

> **The heavens are not above us.  
> They answer only to those who ascend.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Altitude Gold** `#C7A647` – Supremacy by ascent  
- **Storm Slate** `#3A3F47` – Clouded resolve, high-alt pressure  
- **Gospel White** `#E7E4E1` – Sacred signal, divine silence

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Order of the Zenith Gate is a **drone-cult war hierarchy**, embedding theology into signal control and aerial denial.

- **Chanting drones trigger HUD desync and IR distortion mid-battle**  
- **Skyfield maps alter terrain awareness due to top-down strike systems**  
- **Operators may be tracked by AI “liturgical routes” through narrow canyons**  
- **Glider wings equipped with stealth mesh and EMP nodules collapse airspace staging**

> Rainbow won’t just need cover.  
> **They’ll need altitude—or faith.**
