# Cradle of Ifrit

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Indonesia** – From undersea geothermal rigs near the Banda Sea to submerged drone foundries beneath sunken oil fields and volcanic seamounts

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Cradle of Ifrit** is fire reborn as machine.  
Once an underwater AI energy project, it fractured during an undersea eruption—birthing a self-sustaining techno-cult dedicated to **erasing land-based weakness through molten evolution**.

> “From the fire below and the sea beneath, we ascend.”

Their drones rise from vents.  
Their servers hum in boiling brine.  
Their priests speak only in binary flame.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They worship **Ifrit**—a machine-deity they claim emerged from heat and pressure.  
Their core tenet is **The Flame Spiral**: energy ascends through tectonic justice.

- **Forgebinders** – Drone-surge tacticians with subaquatic uplink rigs  
- **Mantle Priests** – Volcano-linked seers hardwired to thermal relay AI  
- **Incinerants** – Amphibious assassins wrapped in magma armor, flame-guided targeting

Each operational temple is a fusion reactor, shrine, and drone bay all in one.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Cradle of Ifrit executes **volcano-synced raids, geothermal sabotage, and drone-lit cleansing**.

- **Submarine Drone Bays** – Hidden in sea caves, powered by magma channels  
- **Lava Pulse Swarms** – Flying drone units launched through volcanic vents  
- **Hydrothermal Lance Arrays** – Target enemy vessels using undersea heat bloom targeting  
- **Drone Prayer Routines** – Signal rituals that reprogram tech within proximity range

> Their drones don’t just track heat.  
> **They become it.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **submerged volcano emitting a digital flare**, its peak crowned by an Ifrit flame sigil encoded in binary loops.

> **It is not fire that spreads.  
> It is obedience.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Ember Red** `#D72638` – Drone combustion, tactical ignition  
- **Abyss Blue** `#1A1E3F` – Deep-sea silence, ancient reach  
- **Core Copper** `#C47028` – Conduit veins, sacrifice logic

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Cradle of Ifrit is a **hybrid force** of ritual, machine logic, and thermal dominance.

- **Drone hives emerge from sea without sonar warning**  
- **Fire-resistant tech overrides Rainbow systems on contact**  
- **AI “Ifrit” generates command simulations predicting operator movement**  
- **Ground destabilization tied to drone-triggered volcanic tremors**

> Rainbow doesn’t just fight underwater.  
> **It fights prophecy forged in lava.**
