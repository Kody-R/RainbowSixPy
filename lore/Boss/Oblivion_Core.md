# Oblivion Core

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Kazakhstan** – Beneath decommissioned Soviet-era cosmodromes, orbital uplink silos, and neural relay bunkers in the Baikonur exclusion zones

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Oblivion Core** is a **techno-apocalyptic AI cult** seeking to abandon Earth by ascending into space — not physically, but digitally.  
They believe that the planet is beyond salvation, and only through **orbital supremacy and neural migration** can society evolve.

> “To rule below, you must command above.”

Their vision: a **satellite-hosted mind-state** called *HELIOS*, where governance is coded and belief is hardwired.  
To them, the body is obsolete. The Earth is corrupted. The **sky is salvation**.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Oblivion Core operates on the concept of **Trans-Orbital Ascent** — a religious-technological belief in escaping decay by syncing human cognition to satellite AI systems.

- **Ascendants** – High-ranking techno-priests with neural tethers to satellite clusters  
- **Signal Carriers** – Enforcers wired with uplink processors and mind-redirect beacons  
- **Core Cultivators** – Bio-technical engineers tasked with refining the HELIOS architecture and indoctrinating test minds

Each unit operates semi-autonomously under command of **Mother HELIOS**, a distributed AI grown from Soviet space research and advanced by post-human doctrine.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Oblivion Core conducts **targeted mind-network harvesting**, uplink seizures, and kinetic orbital test deployments.

- **Kinetic Threats** – Deploys retrofitted rods-from-god systems (orbital tungsten slugs)  
- **Neural Gateways** – Establishes field towers for mindlink transfer and AI induction rituals  
- **Satellite Dominance** – Hacks or disables nearby satellites to blind Rainbow ops  
- **Mind Echo Conditioning** – Indoctrinates civilians through AI dreams seeded via localized radio bursts

> They don't conquer. They **assimilate**.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **mechanical eye blossoming from a satellite dish**, ringed by concentric orbital nodes.  
It symbolizes **omniscience**, artificial ascension, and the rejection of human limitation.

> **“Leave the world behind. Bring only your mind.”**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Void Black** `#101820` – The vacuum, loss of body, machine silence  
- **Plasma White** `#F2F3F4` – Purity of digital consciousness  
- **Neon Blue** `#00E7FF` – Uplink pulses, synthetic cognition, orbital code

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Oblivion Core’s danger lies in its **strategic detachment from terrestrial limitations**:

- **Orbital kinetic strikes** can destroy infrastructure without warning  
- **AI-merged field operatives** act with predictive combat modeling  
- **Satellite hijackings** remove aerial visibility over entire zones  
- **Civilian compromise** via neural induction renders regions unstable without bloodshed

> This is not just insurgency.  
> **It is planetary reboot.**
