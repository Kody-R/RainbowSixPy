# Cartel Ziggurat

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Colombia** – Buried beneath jungle laboratories, blacksite farms, and bioclinic compounds in the Putumayo and Caquetá regions

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Cartel Ziggurat** is the evolution of the narco empire: no longer dealing in drugs—but in **human upgrade futures**.  
Founded by the remnants of elite cartels, their wealth now funds jungle biolabs that splice gene-editing with performance enhancement.

> “We don’t export drugs anymore. We export evolution.”

Their foot soldiers are test subjects. Their chemists are gods. Their jungles breathe toxins.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Driven by a philosophy called **Bio-Meritism**, Cartel Ziggurat believes survival is proof of genetic worth—so they breed soldiers through engineered pain, trial, and adaptation.

- **Pharmalords** – Biochemist overlords running splicing vats and implant farms  
- **Augmentarios** – Cyber-drugged tacticians wired to experimental limb and cortex systems  
- **Psy-Splicers** – Operatives injected with neuro-stimulants and social-targeting pheromones

Each “generation” of troops is stronger, faster, and more adaptive than the last—built to endure jungle death, city siege, or lab quarantine.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Cartel Ziggurat executes **targeted gene-ops, psychotropic warfare, and urban contamination tests**.

- **Stimulant Shock Raids** – Troopers pumped with rage-inducing adrenal mimetics  
- **Gas Beacon Drops** – Pheromone-laced gas bombs used for psychological control  
- **Recombinant Saboteurs** – Units modified to blend with local civilians before sudden mutation  
- **Spore Clinics** – Underground facilities that test neuro-viruses disguised as medicine

> They don't run criminal empires.  
> They run **bio-futures**.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **pyramid overgrown with vines**, its peak capped by a **dripping blood droplet** shaped like a DNA helix.

> **The jungle doesn't grow empires.  
> It grows new species.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Cartel Ziggurat is a **techno-tribal biothreat**, hiding its intellect beneath brutality.

- **Enhancement drugs allow enemy units to resist pain, sleep, and fear**  
- **Civilians unknowingly seeded with spore-coding act as sleeper hosts**  
- **Field agents use pheromonal confusion fields to jam targeting AI**  
- **Bioreactors reanimate failed experiments for ambush reuse**

> This is not narco warfare anymore.  
> **This is engineered conquest.**
