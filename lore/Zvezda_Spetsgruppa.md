Zvezda Spetsgruppa
🌍 Region of Origin:
Post-Soviet Territories – Operates primarily from deep within Siberia and Arctic dead zones

🎴 Overview:
Born from the frostbitten remains of Cold War black ops, Zvezda Spetsgruppa ("Star Special Group") is a paramilitary phantom, composed of disavowed Spetsnaz, rogue scientists, and chemical warfare engineers long thought buried in the snow. Where others dismantled weapons, Zvezda preserved them. Where others erased data, Zvezda encrypted it in permafrost vaults.

This is not a faction of ideologues — they are survivalists of a bygone superpower, refusing to die with it.

🧠 Doctrine & Structure:
Zvezda operates under the doctrine of "Kholodnyy Zakon" — the Cold Law. It emphasizes containment, denial, and controlled escalation. Their leadership, referred to only as The Directorate, is rumored to operate from subterranean nuclear silos beneath the Ural Mountains, issuing kill-orders via one-time-pad radio bursts.

Units are organized into Cells, each named after celestial bodies and trained in specific retaliatory protocols. No unit ever sees the full picture, maintaining operational obscurity even within their own ranks.

⚔️ Operations Profile:
Zvezda Spetsgruppa is surgical and brutal, a faction whose battlefield is the silence between geopolitical headlines. Their activities include:

Site Protection: Securing derelict Soviet-era weapon caches, including rumored psychochemical agents and unmapped nuclear warheads.

Icebreaker Sabotage: Disabling surveillance and transit routes through the Arctic and Northern Sea Route.

Tech Resurrection: Reviving decommissioned Soviet tech — from cold fusion prototypes to railgun platforms — rearming them with modern control systems.

They act as the custodians of Cold War sins — and the enforcers of its resurrection.

🎖️ Insignia Description:
Their insignia bears a Crimson Star split by a jagged frozen lightning bolt, hovering above a black tactical visor. The broken star symbolizes both their shattered empire and the power they’ve chosen to preserve. The visor represents anonymity — no face, no mercy, no names.

🎨 Faction Colors:
Crimson Star #8B0000 – The blood of fallen comrades and lost ideology

Siberian Gray #A9A9A9 – Frost, metal, and cold silence

Midnight Frost #001F3F – Arctic shadows and buried truths

🗡️ Threat Analysis:
Encounters with Zvezda units are rare and devastating. Survivors report coordinated ambushes using electromagnetic warfare, suppressed sniper overwatch, and chemical drones that neutralize entire squads without a shot fired.

Their presence signals that something buried — something forbidden — has been disturbed. Missions near ex-Soviet research sites should assume Zvezda is already watching.
