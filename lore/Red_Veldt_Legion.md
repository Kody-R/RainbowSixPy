# Red Veldt Legion

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**South Africa** – Active across the veldts, conflict zones of the Congo, and abandoned colonial mining belts

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Red Veldt Legion** was born not in a lab, a temple, or a think tank — but in the **fires of rebellion**.  
Forged by **ex-miners**, **war orphans**, and **deserting soldiers** during South Africa’s bloodied proxy conflicts, this faction has no central doctrine — only **fire, scrap, and rage**.

They are a **legion of the left-behind** — a **mobile insurgency** wrapped in dust and trauma, building empires out of **rusted steel and broken promises**.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Red Veldt Legion follows the unwritten law of **"Shisa Mhlaba"** — *Burn the Earth*.  
They believe **nothing grows without first reducing the old to ash**.

Their structure is **clan-based**, guided by:

- **War-chiefs**  
- **Fixer-shamans**  
- **Relic-bearers** — who carry forward lessons carved into bone, metal, and scavenged dog tags  

Each fireteam is called a **Pride**, defending its territory with **brute force**, **survivalism**, and **cultural vengeance**.

- **Education** comes through combat  
- **Loyalty** is earned in the flames  
- **Advancement** happens only when a superior falls

---

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Red Veldt Legion is **chaos weaponized** — a guerilla force with no need for precision, only **persistence**.  
Their tactics include:

- **Scavenger Warfare:** Welded-together tanks, repurposed drones, and black market cybernetics scavenged from mercenary corpses  
- **Uprising Catalysts:** Infiltrating labor disputes, political protests, and tribal feuds to spark systemic collapse  
- **Burn Trail Strategy:** Scorching, salt-mining, and booby-trapping resource zones to deny enemies even hollow victory  

> They don’t just fight in warzones — **they create them**.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
The emblem is a **lion’s skull**, symbolizing **extinct royalty** and **reclaimed strength**, mounted above **crossed pickaxes** — a tribute to their **mining roots**.  
Behind it rises a **stylized veldtscape sunrise**, evoking both **scorched heritage** and the **brutal dawn** they believe is coming.

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Red Veldt units hit **hard and fast**, employing:

- **Smoke storms**  
- **IED herding tactics**  
- **Mech-hybrids** built from stolen construction gear  

They ambush military supply trains, hijack UN drops, and leave **propaganda burned into hillsides** — not as calls for negotiation, but as **warnings**.

> They’ve come to **flip the table** and **mine the wreckage**.
