Red Veldt Legion
🌍 Region of Origin:
South Africa – Active across the veldts, conflict zones of the Congo, and abandoned colonial mining belts

🎴 Overview:
The Red Veldt Legion was born not in a lab, a temple, or a think tank — but in the fires of rebellion. Forged by ex-miners, war orphans, and deserting soldiers during South Africa’s bloodied proxy conflicts, this faction has no central doctrine — only fire, scrap, and rage.

They are a legion of the left-behind. A mobile insurgency wrapped in dust and trauma, building empires out of rusted steel and broken promises.

🧠 Doctrine & Structure:
The Red Veldt Legion follows the unwritten law of "Shisa Mhlaba" — Burn the Earth.
They believe nothing grows without first reducing the old to ash.

Their structure is clan-based, guided by war-chiefs, fixer-shamans, and relic-bearers who carry forward lessons carved into bone, metal, and scavenged dog tags.
Each fireteam is known as a Pride, and each Pride defends its territory with a fusion of brute force, survivalism, and cultural vengeance.

Education comes through combat. Loyalty is earned in the flames. Advancement happens only when a superior falls.

⚔️ Operations Profile:
The Red Veldt Legion is chaos weaponized — a guerilla force with no need for precision, only persistence. Their tactics include:

Scavenger Warfare: Using welded-together tanks, repurposed drones, and black market cybernetics pulled from mercenary corpses.

Uprising Catalysts: Infiltrating labor disputes, political protests, and tribal feuds to spark systemic collapse.

Burn Trail Strategy: Leaving resource zones scorched, salt-mined, and booby-trapped to deny enemies even victory.

They don’t just fight in warzones — they create them.

🎖️ Insignia Description:
Their emblem is a lion’s skull, symbolizing extinct royalty and reclaimed strength, mounted above crossed pickaxes — a tribute to their mining roots. Behind it rises a stylized veldtscape sunrise, evoking both scorched heritage and the brutal dawn they believe is coming.

🎨 Faction Colors:
Dust Orange #CC7722 – Blistering heat, relentless resolve

Blood Earth #5C4033 – Soil stained with struggle and sacrifice

Blasted Gold #E1A95F – The glint of stolen wealth and scorched victory

🗡️ Threat Analysis:
Red Veldt units hit hard and fast, using smoke storms, IED herding tactics, and mech-hybrids built from stolen construction gear. They have been known to ambush military supply trains, hijack UN drops, and leave propaganda burned into hillsides — messages not of negotiation, but warning.

They are not looking for a place at the table.
They’ve come to flip the table and mine the wreckage.
