### üåê Overview
The *Nova Hydra Directive* is the ghost of the Cold War ‚Äî a rogue military command composed of ex-generals, blacksite AI war planners, and deep-state holdouts operating from ancient missile silos and underground bases. Their endgame? Total reset. Through scorched-earth tactics and doomsday arsenals, they plan to trigger a controlled global collapse. Their enforcers, *Zvezda Spetsgruppa*, are elite Russian operatives entrusted with guarding pre-collapse weapon stockpiles and carrying out unsanctioned nuclear missions.

This dual-faction arc is the endgame hammer ‚Äî one force commands the playbook, the other pulls the trigger.
