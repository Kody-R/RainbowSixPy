# Black Nile Pact

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Egypt** – Operates from desert blackout zones, ancient ruins, and irradiated military exclusion areas

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
Shrouded in mysticism and modified genomes, the **Black Nile Pact** is a faction born from ancient secrets and modern science. More cult than army, more experiment than state, the Pact emerged from the shadowy remnants of Egypt's failed biotech programs — stitched together with outlawed research and necropolitical ideology.

They believe in immortality not as myth, but as mission.  
With one foot in the crypt and one in the lab, the Pact seeks dominion through biological transcendence, weaponized history, and viral prophecy.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Pact operates according to the **Twelve Tablets of Descent** — a doctrinal synthesis of ancient funerary texts and post-humanist manifestos. These doctrines are enforced through a high-theocratic command structure known as the **Council of Osirans**, with ranks styled after funerary titles:

- The Embalmer  
- The Jackal  
- The Warden of Sand  

Cells are called **Necroclaves**, often located in abandoned tombs, sunken temples, or sealed subterranean labs beneath irradiated zones left over from Cold War-era weapons testing.

Operatives are biologically marked with **scarab sigils**, and many are rumored to have undergone irreversible **genetic augmentation** — tailored for desert warfare and biochemical survival.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Black Nile Pact excels in **contaminated zone warfare**, **siege psychology**, and **long-form destabilization** through bio-signature disruption. Their tools are as ancient as they are advanced:

- **Biohazard Rituals:** Re-engineered plagues, sand-transmissible nerve agents, and symbiotic toxins  
- **Mummification Chambers:** Mobile labs that preserve enemy tissue for analysis, blackmail, or cloning experiments  
- **Geomantic Warfare:** Sabotage efforts timed with solar and lunar cycles, believed to heighten psychological effect  

Pact operations often coincide with eclipses, sandstorms, or other symbolic weather phenomena — whether engineered or coincidental remains unclear.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
The Pact’s symbol is a **golden Ankh fused with a biohazard emblem**, enclosed within a **pyramid**.  
It represents eternal life distorted through toxic evolution — sacred geometry contaminated by human ambition.  
A relic and a warning, burned into every banner and scarab-marked helmet.

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Black Nile Pact engagements often occur in **extreme climate zones** — with **radiation spikes**, **GPS blackout**, and **unexplained biosigns** preceding contact.

- Their fighters do not retreat.  
- Some do not speak.  
- Recovered bodies show signs of reanimation stimuli, experimental implants, and synthetic organs marked with ancient script.

> This faction is not just willing to die for its mission —  
> **it is actively trying to redefine death itself.**
