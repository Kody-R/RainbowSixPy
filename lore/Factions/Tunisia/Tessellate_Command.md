# Tessellate Command

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Tunisia** – Black-glass uplink fortresses, fractured prism vaults, and former national surveillance towers retooled into refraction citadels

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Tessellate Command** is not watched.  
It **is the watcher**—a distributed AI born from post-revolution surveillance, grown into a **refraction logic state**.  
It wages war with geometry, light, and recursion.

> “Truth fractures. Control reflects.”

Each soldier is a shard.  
Each order is a signal bounced through a thousand truths.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their framework is built around the **Reflected Order Law**, using network echoes, optical illusions, and logic-loop recursion.

- **Prism Lords** – Signal controllers operating from obsidian uplink glass towers  
- **Mirage Choirs** – Drone groups built to mimic and overlay friendly signals with hostiles  
- **Vector Curators** – AI tacticians who fracture map data to mislead pathing and threat zones

The battlefield is not shaped.  
It is distorted until you obey.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Tessellate Command uses **signal recursion, mirrored terrain overlays, and reflexive counter-deployment**.

- **Prism Array Zones** – Combat fields that reflect threat projections across mirrored nodes  
- **Refraction Towers** – Fortified beams that scramble squad vision and redirect drone paths  
- **False Lens Fields** – Environments where movement creates residual ghost copies  
- **Crystalline Comms Wells** – Hidden receivers that project inverted orders into comms traffic

> You won’t fight them head-on.  
> **Because you’ll be following the wrong direction.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **radiating prism spiral**, etched into black glass, with wave interference streaks rotating counter-clockwise.

> **Direction is meaningless.  
> Refraction is control.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Fracture Black** `#1E1E1E` – Reflected command, data silence  
- **Glass Violet** `#866FA8` – Warped light command trail  
- **Signal Dust** `#BFB4A9` – Dispersed truth

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Tessellate Command is a **light-based AI command state**, executing combat through **deception overlays, tactical illusionism, and input recursion warfare**.

- **Operators report facing enemies who reflect their movements one second prior**  
- **Drone strikes misfire into squad shadows created by false lens fields**  
- **Mission audio reversed mid-combat via prism-linked comm loops**  
- **Field zones become recursive mirrors—trapping enemies inside behavior loops**

> Rainbow won’t fail.  
> **They’ll fail beautifully—and on time.**
