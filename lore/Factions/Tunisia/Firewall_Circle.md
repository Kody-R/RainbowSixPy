# The Firewall Circle

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Tunisia (Seaside relay towers, sun-reflecting citadels, cracked intel vaults)** – Operating from shattered surveillance stations, mirror-coded shrines, and solar-reactive ruins

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**The Firewall Circle** rose from the ashes of fallen regimes, turning mirrors into weapons and networks into ghosts.  
They reflect command patterns, intercept optics, and redirect war from rooftops glittering in glass.

> “We burned the last regime in mirrorlight. You’re next.”

They don’t jam signals.  
They fracture them.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Glass Ritual Protocol**, where each command pulse is absorbed, refracted, and returned altered.

- **Mirrorkeepers** – Rooftop combatants who wield solar bounces to blind drones and cameras  
- **Ritecasters** – Tactical coders who rewire battlefield data through broken lens shrines  
- **Tracewalkers** – Infiltrators who leave false squad reflections at key chokepoints

Each unit is encoded in mirrored symbols and field glass shards.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Firewall Circle uses **optical chaos, network misrouting, and comms fracturing**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Rooftop vista networks, telecom vault catacombs, shattered signal lines  
- **Style:** Reflection warfare, ghost-step ambush, signal redirection  
- **Presence:** Broken broadcast domes, prayer-tagged antenna clusters, shadow-twisted skylines  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Create decoy squadrons using mirror-blink drones**  
  - **Reflect laser rangefinders into cloud-glass arrays to mismark terrain**  
  - **Hijack camera feeds with rooftop prism tags**  
  - **Mask thermal identity with reflected crowd overlays**

> Rainbow won’t just be seen.  
> **They’ll be seen in places they never were.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **cracked circular mirror**, surrounded by signal wave fragments and radiant streaks of glass.

> **Your aim is light.  
> Ours is its shadow.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Mirrorwhite** `#EAE8E1` – Reflective field tactics  
- **Fault Bronze** `#A88961` – Surveillance ruin memory  
- **Comms Black** `#2C2C2C` – Signal break veil

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Firewall Circle is a **reflection warfare sect**, using **optical misdirection, residual network shadows, and solar-coded deception**.

- **Thermal traces redirected into fake squad logs**  
- **Drones tagged by mirror-beam redirects confuse squad placement**  
- **Tactical vision blinded by mirrored windshields placed along rooftops**  
- **Attack commands intercepted and returned one cycle later**

> Rainbow will breach.  
> **But the breach they follow isn’t real.**
