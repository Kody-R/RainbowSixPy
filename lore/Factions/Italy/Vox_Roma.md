# Vox Roma

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Italy** – Beneath Vatican ruins, encrypted catacombs in Rome, and fortified signal chapels across the Apennines

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Vox Roma** is not a remnant—it is a resurrection.  
A technotheocratic order built from Vatican archives, defunct defense AIs, and neural liturgy designed to **reimpose Roman order through faith-scripted warfare**.

> “Order is eternal. Faith is encoded.”

They speak in encrypted doctrine.  
They command relic weapons with biometric rites.  
They do not conquer—they **canonize control**.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Vox Roma follows the **Codex Ordinatus**, a neural manuscript blending Roman military law, Christian liturgy, and machine ethics.

- **Archivists of Flame** – AI-guided field priests with access to doctrinal override codes  
- **Sanctum Lectors** – Chant-engineers who write battle orders into encrypted scrolls  
- **Censer Guards** – Heavy infantry augmented with drone-censer armor and liturgical command nodes

Each strike begins with a verse and ends in ritual silence.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Vox Roma deploys **ritual-enforced tactics, scripture-guided signal control, and relic-enabled combat armor**.

- **Signal Chapels** – Battle nodes styled as ruined monasteries with uplink towers beneath  
- **Reliquary Vaults** – Weapon caches buried in ossuaries, guarded by icon-triggered defense AI  
- **Liturgical Interdiction Zones** – Areas marked with chant grids that disrupt comms and movement logic  
- **Echo Mosaics** – Ceiling-fitted drone arrays that fire based on movement inside historical pattern grids

> They don’t just protect territory.  
> **They sanctify it.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **burning tome overlayed with a cybernetic laurel**, surrounded by fractured Roman numerals.

> **This is not nostalgia.  
> It’s reclamation.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Vox Roma is a **technoscriptural sovereign force**, reviving history as a command structure and executing war as liturgy.

- **Comms blackout triggered by psalm-coded jammers hidden in chapel towers**  
- **Rainbow operators misidentify terrain due to holographic overlays of Roman city plans**  
- **Sacred zones emit “forgiveness loops” that disable IFF and halt drone activity**  
- **Operators report battlefield hallucinations of ceremonial orders**

> Rainbow won’t just fight for the future.  
> **They’ll have to survive the past rewritten in code.**
