# The Choir of Ash

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Italy (Southern ruins, bombed basilicas, Vatican sub-chapels)** – Operate from hollowed-out cathedrals, scorched reliquaries, and crypt-networks laced with acoustic dampers

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Choir of Ash** sings through ruin.  
They are monks of the broken age—echoing psalms through hollow marble and shielding their strikes in sacred resonance.

> “Where marble crumbles, we sing.”

They do not fight for territory.  
They fight to preserve a myth of Italy that only they remember, even as it burns around them.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow **The Lament Codex**, a collection of anti-drone harmonics, urban rituals, and liturgical sabotage methods.

- **Psalm Carriers** – Frontline jammers who wield re-purposed sensor horns disguised as incense burners  
- **Cryptborn** – Fighters who use tunnels beneath basilicas for ambush strikes  
- **Ash Vespers** – Voice-snipers trained to disrupt Rainbow’s targeting system via resonant echo shouts

Attacks often coincide with bells or festival dates—each assault a funeral for forgotten grandeur.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Choir of Ash uses **sonic disruption, visual illusion through architecture, and relic-shard explosives**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Ruined basilicas, museum crypts, bell tower zones  
- **Style:** Trap-laced ruin defense, frequency denial, echo strikes  
- **Presence:** Candlelit catacombs, dome-split sanctuaries, cloaked marble courtyards  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Activate acoustic fields that jam auto-targeting with Gregorian chant loops**  
  - **Bury signal IEDs inside reliquary urns that explode when scanned**  
  - **Use stained glass projectors to create phantom silhouettes at range**  
  - **Release ash-dust cloaks to distort thermal signatures inside chapels**

> Their faith isn’t in gods.  
> **It’s in the silence after the bell.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **cracked censer**, trailing black ash upward into a shattered cathedral rose window.

> **We don’t restore beauty.  
> We weaponize its ghost.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Ash Marble** `#BFB5AA` – Broken purity, ruin veil

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Choir of Ash is a **post-devotional insurgency** using sacred ruin as both camouflage and amplifier.

- **Combat occurs inside jamming domes synced to ruined bell systems**  
- **Rainbow ops report disorientation inside reverb-heavy sanctuaries**  
- **Fragment traps use marble shards infused with acoustic delay dust**  
- **Thermal ID suppressed by thick smoke containing trace goldleaf ash**

> Rainbow will hear them coming.  
> **And then forget where they were.**
