# The Null Tide

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Australia (Central Outback, Woomera test corridors, Nullarbor blackout zone)** – Survival bunkers hidden in static valleys, salt-laced ridge traps, and post-signal hunting camps

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Null Tide** rose from the silence.  
Where satellites burned and drones dropped dead, they thrived.  
Descendants of signal crews and analog rebels, they navigate by stars, scrap tech, and intuition.

> “No signal. No master.”

They believe the world collapsed when we trusted machines.  
So they hunt in silence—and teach the Grid to fear the dark.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their belief, called **The Broken Ping**, sees electromagnetic quiet as divine.  
Their structure mimics a weathered ops crew: tight, ruthless, self-sufficient.

- **Clayshades** – Trap-layers with solar proximity detonators and mine maps  
- **Dustrunners** – Scouts equipped with solar rigged goggles and RF-suppression packs  
- **Black Echoes** – Ambush leaders who use pulse-blind “smoke” to drop entire comms nets

Every action begins with a ritual known as **“the drop”**—a full power cut and breath-held strike.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Null Tide uses **EMP-ravaged terrain, solar-scrap weapons, and analog disruption**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Salt flats, crag zones, collapsed relays, canyon routes  
- **Style:** Zero-EM ghost movement, analog ambush chains, droneblind kills  
- **Presence:** Decommissioned antennas, dustflooded bunkers, defunct radar shells  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Trigger portable static clouds to blind thermals**  
  - **Create anti-signal rings from rusted broadcast spires**  
  - **Scramble enemy maps using reflective decoy canisters**  
  - **Use solar-charged mines that detonate by sound and shadow**

> They don’t jam signals.  
> **They erase their memory.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **broken satellite dish rising from rusted desert stone**, split by a null waveform.  
The mark of survival through silence.

> **No echo.  
> No warning.  
> Just rust and ruin.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Dust Chrome** `#C1B79A` – Sunfaded steel, scavenged purpose  
- **Black Rust** `#3B3A36` – Post-industrial grit, silent oath  
- **Static Orange** `#F26430` – Sudden flare, last light

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Null Tide are **anti-tech nomads**—their strength lies in silence, sabotage, and EMP ritual.

- **Deploy static-cloud launchers that blind heatseeking tech**  
- **Operators wear signal-deflecting cloaks woven with foil layers**  
- **Disguise IEDs as survey tools and mining debris**  
- **Use rail-spike pits and scrap-triggers to trap AI-led ops**

> Rainbow has gear.  
> **Null Tide has dust—and patience.**
