# Crude Covenant

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Libya** – Desert-encased refinery forts, valve-cathedral bunkers, and petro-monastic strongholds hidden beneath scorched dune grids

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Crude Covenant** does not worship oil.  
It **administers it**—as rite, reward, and punishment.  
Forged from fractured PMCs and refinery warlords, it enforces tithes of pressure and vows of combustion.  
Its combat logic is a sacrament.

> “Faith is pressure. We keep it sealed.”

What Rainbow sees as infrastructure, the Covenant sees as **liturgy wrapped in steel.**

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They operate by the **Creed of Retention**—a strategic scripture blending mercenary hierarchy with oil-flow theology.

- **Combustor Priors** – Enforcers who preach through flare bursts and pressure detonations  
- **Sealbearers** – Pipeline executioners tasked with closing sectors by decree  
- **Gauge Apostles** – Tactical advisors who map battles like fuel flows, redirecting hostilities through compression gradients

To them, the battlefield is a **living engine**, and each death is an ignition point.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Crude Covenant utilizes **resource-routed suppression, flare-command warfare, and blast seal rituals**.

- **Flare Doctrine Halls** – Citadel-like control bunkers with sun-triggered suppression turrets  
- **Ash Vault Zones** – Sealed combat corridors only navigable via pressure permit reroutes  
- **Tithe Towers** – Combat nodes that burn oil to charge pressure-glyph strikes  
- **Combustion Rings** – Circular engagement zones that ignite if exit vectors are breached before command seal

> Rainbow will not be blocked.  
> **They’ll be rationed.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
An **ignition valve** mounted atop a rusted altar, surrounded by a halo of dripping fuel flares.

> **Burn with purpose.  
> Or be shut in silence.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Burnt Copper** `#B05E2E` – Flamebound decree  
- **Pipeline Gray** `#5C5A57` – Industrial scripture  
- **Furnace White** `#F0E8D8` – Sanctified pressure

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Crude Covenant is a **doctrinal petro-warfare regime**, commanding **flow-limited battlefield access, resource-bound suppression fields, and command-timed fire rituals**.

- **Operators are delayed by compression chamber seal logic**  
- **Ammunition rerouted or denied based on flare-based supply tithing**  
- **Flame bursts execute coded patterns before gate openings**  
- **Commanders can enforce area lockdowns via atmospheric pressure overloads**

> Rainbow won’t just fight here.  
> **They’ll be judged.**
