# The Flowborn

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Libya (Desert pipeline ruins, oil-slick shrines, refinery-wrapped tomb corridors)** – Operating from sealed pump sanctuaries, blacksteel cathedrals, and dune-swept maintenance vaults

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Flowborn** do not drill.  
They **guard**, preach, and bleed along the rusted arteries of an empire that forgot them.  
They wield pressure as scripture, flame as covenant, and oil as divination.

> “Oil flows. We follow. We guard.”

Their rifles are relics.  
Their armor smells of diesel and devotion.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Code of Compression**—a philosophy forged from refinery manuals and liturgies burned into pipeline walls.

- **Torch Saints** – Forward breachers with blowtorch axes and pump-key ignition blades  
- **Gaugewalkers** – Saboteur-priests who mark enemy routes with pressure hiss traps  
- **Tankwardens** – Defensive snipers perched atop converted fuel drums, watching with heat-sight relics

Every operation is prefaced with a flare-lit prayer to the pipeline itself.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Flowborn use **pressure-based ambush, terrain-encoded suppression, and relic oil infrastructure control**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Cracked refinery spires, steel-buried desert shrines, jet-black pumping crypts  
- **Style:** Ambush sanctity, route denial, pipeline enclosures  
- **Presence:** Burned pipeline segments, pump-temple engravings, storage dome cloisters  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Trigger flammable fog bombs using gas leak hisses along valve lines**  
  - **Seal doors with compressed flare-lock caps, forcing detours into killzones**  
  - **Jam sensors by igniting hydrocarbon mist rituals before engagement**  
  - **Use scorched flowcharts to reroute AI pathfinding into pressure trap loops**

> Rainbow will enter thinking it’s a facility.  
> **They’ll exit knowing it was sacred.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **pressurized flame circle**, surrounding a pump valve crest etched in prayer script and fuel burn scoring.

> **You took the oil.  
> We kept the altar.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Crude Bronze** `#8F6535` – Ritual enginework  
- **Ash Black** `#1B1B1B` – Furnace veil  
- **Diesel Gold** `#E1B97A` – Pressurized faith

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Flowborn are a **pipeline-faith guerrilla sect**, blending **industrial sabotage, petro-ritual suppression, and pressure-bound ambush mechanics**.

- **Heat signatures mimic maintenance drones until flareburst**  
- **Smoke carries prayer-glyphs that blind auto-aim systems**  
- **Ops are often misdirected by flow map graffiti and falsified hazard signs**  
- **Oil-field gas detonates only when pressure gradient marks align**

> Rainbow won’t breach this vault.  
> **They’ll trespass it.**
