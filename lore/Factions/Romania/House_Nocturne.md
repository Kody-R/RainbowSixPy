# House Nocturne

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Romania** – Operating from beneath ancient castles in the Carpathian Mountains, within bio-crypts and sanctified gene-vaults

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**House Nocturne** is not just a faction — it is a **blood dynasty reborn through science**.  
Once aristocrats of forgotten rule, they now see themselves as the **true inheritors of the Earth**, forging **immortality through engineered bloodlines**.

> “We are what was buried. We are what will return.”

They manipulate myth to mask experimentation, twisting vampiric lore into biotechnology.  
To the world, they are ghosts.  
To Rainbow, they are the **code-engraved architects of extinction**.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
House Nocturne follows a **feudal-genetic hierarchy** rooted in preserved pre-Ottoman bloodlines.

- **Lords of Sequence** – Gene-alchemists who command biological loyalty through engineered blood inheritance  
- **Crimson Knights** – Enhanced guardians with long-range neural implants and reflex conditioning  
- **Bleeding Choir** – Chanting enforcers who weaponize ultrasonic symphonic code to command or disorient

House doctrine preaches that **eternity is not divine — it is designed**, and only those with the genetic keys to memory, authority, and evolution are fit to rule.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
House Nocturne launches **precision raids and bloodline purification campaigns**, often initiated through “awakening rituals” in rural villages.

- **Symbolic Dominance** – Replaces regional relics with their own gene-coded insignias  
- **Crimson Vaults** – Underground facilities for blood-sequencing and ideological indoctrination  
- **Thrall Protocols** – Civilians genetically repurposed as controlled sentries and sacrificial subjects

> When they raid, they don’t take gold or land.  
> They take **lineage**.

---

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
Their emblem is a **bat-winged crest bearing a crowned double helix** — a mark of dominance through designer genetics.

> **“Rule is inherited. Immortality is inherited. We are the proof.”**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
House Nocturne’s operations are **surgical, symbolic, and intergenerational**.

- **Modified troops with enhanced neural reflexes**  
- **Use of symphonic code to disorient or control populations**  
- **Field agents identified only by lineage ID numbers**  
- **Strike teams appear and vanish with no digital trace**

> They are not waging war.  
> **They are restoring a kingdom buried in the blood of others.**
