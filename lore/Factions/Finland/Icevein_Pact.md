# The Icevein Pact

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Finland (Lapland wilderness, Kainuu forests, buried Arctic radio arrays)** – Hidden within snow-choked bunkers, reindeer trail bunkers, and frost-hardened comms towers

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Icevein Pact** are whispers in the frost—camouflaged partisans and field engineers who've survived beneath Finland’s frozen silence.  
They operate from collapsed Cold War outposts, using dead-zone tech and snow-static to strike from nowhere.

> “The frost hides what the war left behind.”

They don’t shout.  
They jam.  
And they strike when your breath is the only heat left.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They believe in **Glacial Memory**—the idea that cold preserves not just flesh, but purpose.

- **Frostbinders** – Scouts using insulated sensor disruptors and cloaked satchels  
- **Nullhands** – Combat engineers skilled in thermal-dead mine placement  
- **Veil Marks** – Camouflaged snipers with IFF-glitch snow ghillies

Their ranks rotate from fireless camps—melt signatures are betrayal.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Icevein Pact utilizes **cold-environment stealth, thermal masking, and field-sculpted denial traps**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Frozen pine lines, cracked radar domes, drift-buried bunkers  
- **Style:** Ambush, trap-lure, fog-aided positioning  
- **Presence:** Snow curtain zones, hidden signal craters, aurora-blind outposts  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Deploy thermal-invisible claymores activated by sound echo**  
  - **Launch snowfield gliders masked by ambient static**  
  - **Carve radar refraction zones with mirrored ice chips**  
  - **Leave no trace ops: collapse shelters after strike, bury trails with antifreeze ash**

> You’ll never see them coming.  
> **Because the snow already erased them.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
An **ice-capped tower coiled in barbed frost wire**, crowned with a falling snowflake and static burst.

> **What melts dies.  
> What freezes fights again.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Icevein Pact is a **hyper-stealth winter insurgency**, their advantage built on **climate, camouflage, and concealment**.

- **Radar ghosting via snow-dome static fields**  
- **Frozen relay stations that send bait pings to lure drone patrols**  
- **IEDs set in thermally dead ground to avoid satellite signature**  
- **Tactics change by weather pattern — blizzard = full assault trigger**

> Rainbow won’t feel the ambush.  
> **They’ll feel the cold—then nothing.**
