# The Shtorm Diggers

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Ukraine (Donbas Exclusion Corridors, Kharkiv ruins, Mykolaiv drone fields)** – Operating from collapsed bunkers, drone graveyards, and scorched cyber-warfare zones

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Shtorm Diggers** are scavengers of memory and ruin.  
They hunt down shattered drones, strip warzones for echo-logs, and **replay death like it’s raw code**.

> “We mine the ghosts you left behind.”

To outsiders, they are looters.  
To those who’ve heard the phantom screams they broadcast, they are **signal necromancers** with bulletproof resolve.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow **The Red Playback** — a doctrine of recording, erasing, and rewriting war via scrap tech.

- **Echo Rats** – Scouts who bury drone cores with boobytrap firmware triggers  
- **Rebooters** – Hackers wearing salvaged armor spliced with HUD-glitch projectors  
- **Ash Nodes** – Field leaders who mimic old troop audio to lure targets into déjà-vu traps

Their entire warplan is built off ghost data — simulated strikes and relived trauma.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Shtorm Diggers exploit **battlefield memory corruption, digital salvage, and echo-hallucination traps**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Crater fields, bunkered city shells, static-choked comms towers  
- **Style:** Signal replay ambushes, drone corpse weaponization, thermal mirage warzones  
- **Presence:** Camouflaged scrapyards, corrupted broadcast vans, fogged-up bunker nets  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Replay drone footage in comms channels to mimic ongoing battle**  
  - **Deploy self-rebooting drone mines that reactivate on ambient RF**  
  - **Trap thermal scanners with heat-reflecting war debris**  
  - **Broadcast cries for help on friendly channels, loaded with IED delay markers**

> You don’t fight them once.  
> **You fight a version of yourself you’ve already lost.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **broken drone rotor**, wrapped in looping barbed memory wire.  
It marks warfare’s leftovers turned sacrament.

> **We don’t forget war.  
> We make sure you relive it.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Rust Gray** `#7A7A7A` – Collapsed steel, digital corrosion  
- **Wreck Red** `#A03E3E` – Circuit blood, ghost fire  
- **Signal Dust** `#D8D2C8` – Playback fog, memory erosion

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Shtorm Diggers are **conflict archaeologists turned echo-war tacticians**.

- **Battlefields with false audio logs delay Rainbow response by 30+ seconds**  
- **Salvaged drone parts emit friendly IFFs while targeting operatives**  
- **Rebroadcast “success reports” to fake enemy withdrawals**  
- **Can clone voice comms from Rainbow squads mid-mission**

> This is not your war anymore.  
> **It’s theirs to rebroadcast.**
