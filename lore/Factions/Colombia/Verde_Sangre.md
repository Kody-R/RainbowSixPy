# Verde Sangre

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Colombia (Amazonía, Putumayo, and Valle del Cauca)** – Deep jungle encampments, corrupted coca farms, and forgotten guerrilla trails

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Verde Sangre** is what happens when a cartel bleeds into the jungle and the jungle bleeds back.  
Once cartel enforcers and coca runners, they were transformed by **bio-experimentation** and **eco-mysticism**, becoming zealots who worship the rainforest as both **guardian and god**.

> “The jungle heals us. The jungle kills for us.”

Fused with black market pharma tech and fungal biotech, they no longer serve profits—only the will of the green.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Verde Sangre follows a living doctrine known as **La Espora Profunda** (*The Deep Spore*), treating each warrior as an agent of botanical vengeance.

- **Sangradores** – Combat shamans who extract toxin-serums mid-mission  
- **Rootrunners** – Stealth scouts using plant-signaling systems and camouflage grown from symbiotic fungus  
- **Bloomhosts** – Infected berserkers with embedded parasitic stims and delayed pain response

Their leadership is decentralized—spread across jungle hives and guided by **hallucinogenic visions** interpreted from corrupted research logs.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Verde Sangre favors **terrain dominance, biosensory traps, and organic terror**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Jungle, floodplain farms, cave tunnels  
- **Style:** Camouflaged ambushes, gas dispersal, parasitic tracking  
- **Presence:** Lab-ruins, vine-overrun safehouses, tree-canopy hang zones  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Deploy living spore bombs that disable tech**  
  - **Use pheromone trails to mislead Rainbow units**  
  - **Trigger botanical traps via humidity-reactive leaves**  
  - **Surgically implant adrenal glands into “bloom hosts” for berserker waves**

> They don’t shoot first.  
> They let the jungle **consume**.
