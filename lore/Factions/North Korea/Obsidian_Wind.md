# Obsidian Wind

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**North Korea (Mount Paektu shadow zones, hermetic valleys, signal-free ridgelines)** – Operating from camouflaged cliff monasteries, ash-blown forests, and radio-dead bunkers

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Obsidian Wind** is not an army.  
It is a ritual—whispered, disciplined, erased.  
Formed from **bunkerborn battalions, mountain ascetics, and relic-strike squadrons**, they operate without signal, sound, or surrender.

> “We do not fall. We vanish.”

To engage them is to fight smoke wrapped in loyalty.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Doctrine of Dissolution**—a militant monastic code where self-erasure is the highest form of allegiance.

- **Ridgewalkers** – Silent scouts in ash-treated cloaks, trained to move without heartbeat fluctuation  
- **Vowbreakers** – Strike operatives who ignite blackpowder fog fields to blind optics  
- **Eclipse Monks** – Tactical leaders who inscribe strike orders into burnable silk before battle

They vanish before they bleed.  
Their death rites begin at mission launch.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Obsidian Wind uses **silent approach, relic-based ambushes, and terrain shrouding to erase presence**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Volcanic ridges, signal-shrouded valleys, old artillery tunnels  
- **Style:** Stealth overwhelm, precision fog-lure, blackout field denial  
- **Presence:** Memory pits, ritual altars in camo temples, erased road lines  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Deploy gunpowder mist clouds to blind IR and throw sound reflection**  
  - **Use proximity knives tied to breath-pressure sensors, not motion**  
  - **Initiate fights via drone mimicry draped in silk noise baffles**  
  - **Vanish after strikes using flare-coded cliffs to mask ascent trails**

> Rainbow won’t hear them breach.  
> **They’ll only find chalk lines where names used to be.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **tattered black silk triangle pierced by a horizontal blade**, its edge traced with silent wind lines.

> **Sound dies before we do.  
> Our mission ends before we’re found.**

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Obsidian Wind is a **stealth-borne, blackout-combat legion**, fusing **ritualized memory erasure, fog-bound tactics, and non-electronic warfare**.

- **Rainbow HUDs malfunction in mist-cloaked cliffs**  
- **No recorded chatter—only silence logs recovered post-attack**  
- **Thermal targets drop when mist ignites, scattering heat signatures**  
- **Operators found marked with ash glyphs and zero field log entries**

> You won’t see them die.  
> **They left their deaths behind before you arrived.**
