# Nova Forja

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Brazil** – Vertical foundry towers, AI-policed megaslabs, and black smoke citadels rising from Rio’s industrial ruins

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Nova Forja** is the city rebuilt for war.  
Forged from failed police AIs, rogue industrialists, and weaponized infrastructure, they are not defending Brazil’s future—they’re manufacturing it.  
Each street is a factory line.  
Each block is a battleground blueprint.

> “The city is a forge. We are what survives.”

They don’t conquer.  
They construct control.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Nova Forja follows the **Protocol of Recast**, where destruction is followed by immediate urban weaponization.

- **Forge Priors** – Tactical commanders in exo-chassis who design ops in blueprints and steel  
- **Smog Sentinels** – Smokescreen drone handlers who weaponize industrial air  
- **Gridcore Units** – Augmented warfighters synced to urban power networks for instant targeting

Each battlefield is a living schematic—reinforced as they fight.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Nova Forja uses **mech-augmented squads, modular drone warfare, and reactive environmental conversion**.

- **Black Alloy Zones** – Slumblocks converted into armored barracks mid-combat  
- **Choke Smog Fields** – Cloud zones that jam thermal, scent, and drone ping  
- **Forge Spine Rails** – Rooftop weapon mounts extended from telecom towers  
- **Pulseforge Drones** – Air units that reformat powerlines into shockwave emitters

> You don’t clear them out.  
> **You shut them down.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **burning furnace tower**, encased in steel laurels, flanked by rising powerlines drawn in red.

> **Victory is not declared.  
> It’s welded.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Foundry Iron** `#2C2C2C` – Burned steel, structural force  
- **Blast Red** `#B82525` – Weldpoint aggression  
- **Smog Orange** `#FF9A56` – Industrial haze, signal threat

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Nova Forja is a **paramilitary industrial complex**, combining **adaptive infrastructure, mech-class units, and oppressive urban terrain conversion**.

- **Operators ambushed by walls that deploy turrets during breach**  
- **Smog drones blind IR and scatter ultrasonic pings**  
- **Mech squads repair terrain mid-battle to shield key uplinks**  
- **Streetlights used as synchronized sensor-blinders**

> Rainbow will not breach the fortress.  
> **They’ll realize they’re inside it.**
