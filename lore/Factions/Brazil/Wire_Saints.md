# The Wire Saints

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Brazil (Rio favelas, rooftop relay shrines, power-grid alley sanctuaries)** – Operating from slum reactor cores, graffiti-tagged signal nodes, and electric gospel rooftops

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Wire Saints** were born in brownouts and raised by street signal.  
Part militia, part sparkborn cult, they strike with scavenged tech and sacred current.  
Their prayers are voltage.  
Their faith is in disruption.

> “In the sprawl, we spark.”

They don't just hit targets.  
They rewire the rules first.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Gospel of Surge**, a doctrine that blends scripture with scavenging, spirituality with short-circuiting.

- **Pulsewalkers** – Agile shock troops with taser-chains and surge tattoos  
- **Graffiti Codexers** – Signal hackers who embed map instructions in rooftop tags  
- **Voltvangelists** – Strike leaders who weaponize power grids with field amps and prayer chants

Their missions are mapped through current, not roads.
