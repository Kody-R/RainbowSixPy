# Delta Revenants

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Nigeria (Niger Delta, Warri oilfields, refinery ghost towns)** – Rising from swamps, rusting pipelines, and shattered villages blackened by fire

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Delta Revenants** were left to drown in crude.  
Now they rise from it—armed, armored, and enraged.  
Born from **abandoned refinery workers, militant ex-labor crews, and mercs left unpaid**, they wage war on anyone who profits from their pain.

> “We bled for oil. Now they bleed for us.”

They wield rusted oil tech like relics. Their rituals are fueled by diesel and vengeance.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their structure follows **pump-station command chains**: localized, cutthroat, and utterly loyal to the man keeping the oil lit.

- **Flarelords** – Fire-squad captains equipped with crude sprayers and incendiary mines  
- **Tarpmen** – Camouflaged swamp infiltrators who strike from flooded pipeways  
- **Spillcallers** – Propagandists who use radio distortion and flame-lit sermons to control towns

Each cell burns a corporate flag before every mission.
