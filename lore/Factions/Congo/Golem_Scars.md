# The Golem Scars

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Congo (Katanga slagfields, Ituri mine belts, Kolwezi dig camps)** – Forged in strip mines, born under collapsed rigs, and hidden within slag-crowned jungle basins

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Golem Scars** are **burned remnants**, survivors of chemical clearances and mineral massacres.  
Once miners, now war-etched insurgents, they cover themselves in ore ash and wield shattered drills like blades.

> “They took the stone. We became it.”

They don’t chant or rally.  
They tunnel, wait, and rise from the scar to drag down the giants who cut it.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their guiding belief is **The Cut**—a wound left by extraction, a place where memory bleeds into iron.

- **Rebar Sentinels** – Shieldbearers armored in drill rig plating, hardened by burn dust  
- **Slagwalkers** – Scout saboteurs who move through exhaust tunnels and ore washouts  
- **Torchbreathers** – Explosive-lure baiters who wear oxygen rigs and carry detonation ash

Each Golem carries a chipped tag made from the machine that once broke them.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Golem Scars rely on **ambush from ruin**, using industrial terrain and mining byproducts as weapons.

- **Primary Terrain:** Quarry fields, jungle-adjacent slag mounds, collapsed shaft corridors  
- **Style:** Brutal melee rushes, underground traps, smoke-flood assaults  
- **Presence:** Abandoned crushers, vent chambers, rusted rail loaders  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Drop smoke mixed with acidic dust to blind heatseeking optics**  
  - **Deploy booby-trapped ore carts with EM-triggered blast cores**  
  - **Seal entryways with slag-collapse detonation lines**  
  - **Mark enemy zones with jagged sculptures as psychological warnings**

> They don’t retreat.  
> **They just dig deeper.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **shattered pickaxe stabbing into a burning cartwheel**, wrapped in broken wire.  
It’s not a crest.  
It’s a scar made to speak.

> **We are not what’s left.  
> We are what remains.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Golem Scars are **low-tech industrial insurgents**, dangerous not in speed—but in resolve and terrain mastery.

- **Ambush through heat-drowned shafts, forcing close-quarters breaks**  
- **Use ore-reactive traps against power armor signatures**  
- **Force psychological retreat through iconography of collapse**  
- **Tactics evolve through terrain: every broken machine becomes a weapon**

> Rainbow won’t see a frontline.  
> **They’ll feel a scar open beneath their boots.**
