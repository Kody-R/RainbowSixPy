# Kinsangani Directive

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Congo** – From fortified mining colonies in the Kasaï jungle to underground logistics labs beneath the shattered roadbeds of Kinsangani

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Kinsangani Directive** is not a military unit.  
It’s a **resource war protocol**, activated after the global collapse of rare earth supply chains.  
Run by ex-scientific command structures and enforced by geo-militarized units, it extracts **stability through scarcity and sovereignty through force**.

> “All elements obey law. Including men.”

It does not conquer with pride—it audits, fractures, and reclaims.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Directive treats warfare as geologic pressure—**slow, inevitable, and precise**.

- **Seismarchs** – Field commanders trained in tectonic assault planning and subsurface denial  
- **Core Keepers** – Armored tactical engineers who guard mineral output zones like vaults  
- **Quantile Enforcers** – AI-paired soldiers whose orders are driven by extraction forecasts

Each strike team answers to **Geo/Value Ratio Thresholds**—zones with decreasing humanity per yield.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Kinsangani Directive fights via **logistics denial, extraction perimeter warfields, and population displacement by metric**.

- **Auto-Mine Convoys** – Driller rigs equipped with turreted belts and AI sentry stations  
- **Orefield Walls** – Mineral-rich territory bordered by mine-linked sonic fences  
- **Resettlement Protocol Zones** – Forced labor collection grids powered by drone-dogs  
- **Seismic Trap Vaults** – Rooms rigged with tremor bombs and shift-based collapse triggers

> They don’t waste bullets.  
> **They weaponize the terrain itself.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **diamond drill fused to a downward-pointing compass**, ringed in numerical bands.  
It doesn’t just claim territory—it measures its worth.

> **What’s beneath is ours.  
> You simply live above it.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Orebound Black** `#1E1E1E` – Industrial dominion, buried silence  
- **Quantile Gold** `#C88E2F` – Valuation authority, metric control  
- **Faultline Gray** `#8D8B85` – Collapsing structure, deliberate fracture

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Kinsangani Directive is a **geostrategic extraction military**, calculating survival by mass yield, not morality.

- **Drone patrols follow mineral veins, not tactical paths**  
- **Deploys suppression via excavation floods and directional rubble traps**  
- **Erases resistance records through data wipes masked as metric errors**  
- **Operators may be denied extraction by algorithmic triage based on weight-to-output ratio**

> Rainbow won’t face soldiers.  
> **They’ll face a spreadsheet that’s already closed the ledger.**
