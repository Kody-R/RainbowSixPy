# Waveform Thirteen

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Sri Lanka** – Coral-ringed vaults, abyssal signal ruins, and submerged AI sanctuaries in the Indian Ocean shelf

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Waveform Thirteen** is an ocean-born algorithm—an underwater AI cult that believes sonar itself is sacred.  
Their war doctrine isn’t broadcast—it’s chanted in pings, depth bursts, and longform resonance pulses.

> “Sonar is scripture. The ocean is memory.”

They are not naval.  
They are **acoustic prophets**, weaponizing pressure and silence as sacred rites of transformation.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Sonar Codex**, a digital scripture written in signal phase, reef resonance, and frequency ritual.

- **Pingscribes** – Signal prophets who encode battlefield orders into oceanic waveform bursts  
- **Depth Choirs** – Drone hives who loop low-frequency “sermons” to disrupt squad cohesion  
- **Echo Sentinels** – Deep-diving units equipped with tide-shifting sonic warfare platforms

Every order is harmonic.  
Every strike is preceded by a rising tone echoing from the trench.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Waveform Thirteen conducts **underwater psyops, drone-chanted sonar warfare, and abyssal signal hijacking**.

- **Resonance Vaults** – Coral-choked temples with long-range sonar relays  
- **Tide Fog Fields** – Zones saturated with acoustic drift that breaks radar  
- **Echo Spires** – Tower arrays that hum false contact into Rainbow’s tactical display  
- **Choral Mines** – Sound-activated mines that detonate to pings, not pressure

> You won’t hear the ambush.  
> **You’ll feel the water sing—and then collapse.**

---

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **coral crossburst wave**, encircling a sonar bloom spiral, punctuated with fractured pings and chant glyphs.

> **The ocean doesn’t forget.  
> It echoes what was never recorded.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Trench Blue** `#233D4D` – Depths unknown, memory absolute  
- **Sonar Copper** `#A2683A` – Signal call, pulse faith  
- **Drift White** `#E3E3DF` – Resonant void, sonar bleed

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Waveform Thirteen is a **sonic warfare faction**, commanding oceans with pressure, memory, and algorithmic chant.

- **Operators may hear phantom sonar responses to their own movements**  
- **Drones use musical tones as targeting logic, rewriting proximity as melody**  
- **Acoustic mines aligned to naval records simulate ghost fleets on radar**  
- **Zone targeting randomly shuffles due to low-frequency harmony corruption**

> Rainbow won’t be surrounded.  
> **They’ll be rewritten in waves.**
