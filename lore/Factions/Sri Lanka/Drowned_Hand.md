# The Drowned Hand

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Sri Lanka (Coral tombs, sunken radar bases, submerged coastal ruins)** – Operating from reef-buried sonar towers, mangrove tunnel sanctuaries, and shipwreck-turned-cipher vaults

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Drowned Hand** was left for dead beneath the tide.  
Ex-naval saboteurs, sonar cultists, and ship graveyard survivors, they fight not with radio—but with resonance.  
They speak in bubble bursts and detonate from the deep.

> “The sea swallowed us. We bite back.”

They use shipwrecks as beacons.  
They make the reefs bleed with mines.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They obey the **Pulse Ritual**, an underwater doctrine that matches aggression to sonar pings and tidal sequence.

- **Echo Divers** – Subsurface ambushers who tag enemy craft with sonar-activated markers  
- **Saltborn Engineers** – Trapsmiths who lay acoustic IEDs using wave-delay relays  
- **Tide Carvers** – Ritual tacticians who predict conflict based on sonar return drift

They act on lunar tide, sonar bounce, and memory of drowned campaigns.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Drowned Hand uses **underwater ambush, signal distortion, and acoustic sabotage**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Sunken docks, tidal caves, flooded airbases  
- **Style:** Low-tech interference, terrain memory warfare, sudden depth strikes  
- **Presence:** Mangrove radar shrines, wrecked hull zones, sonar shard fields  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Trigger mines based on engine rumble sync rather than motion**  
  - **Use sonar lures to simulate distress beacons and fake ship activity**  
  - **Jam ops with rising-tone frequencies masked as natural reef noise**  
  - **Deploy thermal buoy traps that mimic radar signatures of false fleets**

> Rainbow won’t find them.  
> **They’ll feel the pressure drop—and then detonate.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **skeletal hand rising from below the sonar horizon**, fingers grasping a cracked hull compass.

> **We are what you left beneath.  
> Now we surface.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Reef Rust** `#6B4E3D` – Drowned alloy, memory decay  
- **Signal Blue** `#3B9EBE` – Acoustic disruption, ocean scream  
- **Tide Bone** `#D5D6D3` – Echo-laced ruin

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Drowned Hand is an **aquatic ambush militia**, exploiting old sonar routes, ruin-mapped tides, and **acoustic-mine terrain dominance**.

- **Drones routed by low-pitch sonar noise from submerged towers**  
- **Operators may be jammed by echo-tuned tidal disruptions**  
- **Submerged entry points hidden beneath coastal defense scrapfields**  
- **IEDs designed to ping as rescue signals before detonation**

> Rainbow can’t win above water.  
> **And they’ll never see what comes from below.**
