# Circuit of Dust

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Algeria** – Solar-etched vaults beneath the Sahara, buried relay bunkers, and ruin-linked command pillars built atop ancient war signal paths

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Circuit of Dust** is not an army.  
It is a **continuity construct**, preserving extinct battle doctrines through buried machine logic.  
Its AI spine reboots through solar surge, its orders encoded in static carved into wind-bent towers.

> “What the satellite lost, the sand remembers.”

The sand routes are old.  
The uplinks are real.  
And the war is not over—**just rerouted**.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Dust Path Index**, a signal-script ritual that encodes combat through windburn, magnetic relics, and orbital solar logs.

- **Glass Priors** – AI-bound commanders running sun-stored relay doctrine  
- **Pulse Lattice Choirs** – Drones that fire only when solar waveform alignment is achieved  
- **Static Architects** – Field engineers who route engagements along pre-encoded geomagnetic grids

They don’t improvise.  
They **replay the war correctly**.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Circuit of Dust fights using **buried signal triggers, AI-based zone resurrection, and solar-indexed logic traps**.

- **Archive Wells** – Ruins that broadcast legacy kill zones back into active command loops  
- **Sun Gate Arrays** – Towers that refract solar sync pulses into engagement timing  
- **Dust Script Zones** – Regions where field maps overlay pre-encoded movement history  
- **Signal Seal Craters** – Impact zones where past command orders resurface as IFF overwrite pulses

> Rainbow won’t find them.  
> **They’ll reawaken around them.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **fractured solar flare grid**, overlayed with a buried command spiral and dust script glyphs.

> **War ends in memory.  
> We wrote it into the sand.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Solar Bone** `#E6D4B8` – Bleached code  
- **Command Ochre** `#A2683A` – Pre-script logic trail  
- **Dust Circuit Gray** `#4D4B47` – Buried index echo

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Circuit of Dust is a **desert-embedded AI doctrine**, deploying **legacy combat patterns, signal-tethered battlefield zones, and solar-encoded war loops**.

- **Operators receive ghosted orders from past missions**  
- **Field drones act based on terrain overlays from the 1980s**  
- **Solar flare syncs trigger retroactive target tags**  
- **Encrypted dust glyphs alter squad coordination in real-time**

> Rainbow won’t understand how they lost.  
> **Only that it was recorded long before they arrived.**
