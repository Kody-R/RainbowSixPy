# The Ember Strands

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Algeria (Salt mine corridors, desert signal groves, buried detonation fields)** – Operating from scorched cable nests, tribal encryption camps, and sun-bleached circuit shrines

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Ember Strands** are desert signal-farers—**fire-coded messengers**, demolition tacticians, and ghost miners.  
They remember the cables that crossed the sand.  
They speak in flare-pulses, bury traps in war relics, and trace power routes beneath the dunes.

> “The desert does not forget where the wires were buried.”

They are not a militia.  
They are a fuse.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their creed is the **Burn Trace Oath**, a tradition of relinking signal trails through fire, smoke, and buried fragments.

- **Flarebinders** – Scouts who ignite coded fires to misdirect thermal sensors  
- **Minecallers** – Trapsmiths trained in sandline mapping and detonation math  
- **Ash Relays** – Signal priests who transmit encrypted pulse codes through det-cord flamepaths

Each strike zone is laid with memory, and ignited by meaning.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Ember Strands use **thermal misdirection, pulse-timed demolition, and camouflaged field inheritance**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Salt flat ruins, buried detline vaults, signal-burned ridges  
- **Style:** Ambush ignition, ghost routing, sand-trap choreography  
- **Presence:** Broken relay shrines, smoke post mirrors, iron-stamped cave shrines  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Trigger mines with pulse fuses hidden beneath tribal glyph markers**  
  - **Blind Rainbow optics using flare smoke coded with false proximity beacons**  
  - **Use layered sand ridges to rewire sensor logic to past targets**  
  - **Detonate multi-phase ambush trails by timing wind direction and satellite dropouts**

> You’ll find their traces—once they’ve burned through.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **split detonation cord spiraling outward**, its center flared into a burning signal knot.

> **We trace, we time, we vanish.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Ash Gold** `#C3A664` – Burned sand code  
- **Det Cord Red** `#8A3C31` – Flare command  
- **Dust Gray** `#A29C8E` – Memory veil

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Ember Strands are a **signal-burning nomadic demolition network**, weaponizing **lost cable routes, mine-layered legacy trails, and time-coded field logic**.

- **Operators are ambushed where maps show clean terrain**  
- **Detonation trails create false-safe zones**  
- **Optical sensors jammed by pulse-code fire signatures**  
- **Field data corrupted by smoke-written rekey loops**

> Rainbow will walk the old paths.  
> **The Ember Strands already marked where they’ll burn.**
