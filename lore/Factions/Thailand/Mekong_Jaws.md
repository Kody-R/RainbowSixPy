# The Mekong Jaws

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Thailand (Mekong River delta, flooded jungle ruins, canal temple outposts)** – Operating from submerged tombs, silt-covered drug ports, and drone-snaring wetlands

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Mekong Jaws** are river ghosts—amphibious insurgents who strike from below and vanish into the murk.  
They’ve turned jungle rot into weaponry, using waterlogged mines and bioluminescent lures to control terrain beneath the canopy.

> “We strike from under the flood.”

They’re not an army.  
They’re a flood made of knives and silence.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their battle doctrine, known as the **Delta Tongue**, teaches that control of the water is control of the will.

- **Reedskins** – Swamp scouts who carry airburst claymores in fish traps  
- **Siltcallers** – Guerilla engineers who program drone snares into moss-draped ruins  
- **Jungle Lamps** – Ambushers using fungal light tags to distract thermal optics

Their movements mirror the flood cycles—predictable only to the initiated.
