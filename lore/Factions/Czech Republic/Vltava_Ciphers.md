# The Vltava Ciphers

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Czech Republic (Prague tunnel lines, Vltava flood corridors, Cold War metro grids)** – Operate from sub-chambers beneath Prague’s railways and encrypted data shrines hidden in disused city bunkers

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Vltava Ciphers** are a covert signal cult—hacktivists turned tunnel insurgents.  
They live below the floodline, encode their raids in audio packets, and disrupt battlefield cohesion with **layered comms illusions** and **sonic keyloops**.

> “We live in the floodlines. We speak in keys.”

They don’t fire first.  
They confuse, mask, echo—and then leave their enemies shooting ghosts in the dark.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their faith is in **The Torrent Scroll**—a sound-coded archive of post-war data fragments, tactical overlays, and experimental malware rituals.

- **Null Coders** – Acoustic trap artists who lay down phase-warp beacons in reverb corridors  
- **Channel Rats** – Fast-moving tunnel scouts that seed localized encryption bombs  
- **Echo Fangs** – Operatives whose voice-masked frequency armor loops IFF in short bursts

All movements follow echo-maps generated through sonar analysis of flood-swept rail lines.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Vltava Ciphers use **signal desync, auditory hallucination zones, and encoded interference rituals**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Abandoned Prague metro loops, sewer forks, static-stacked service chambers  
- **Style:** Stealth-lure misdirection, signal saturation, tunnel warfare  
- **Presence:** Flood-drained tech shrines, obsolete telecom vaults, echo-locked corridors  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Deploy burst packets that scramble squad cohesion via command spoofing**  
  - **Create sonic displacement fields using inverted metro speaker systems**  
  - **Embed malware in urban ambiance (traffic echo, air vent hums)**  
  - **Trigger attacks via tone triggers encoded into footstep cadence**

> Rainbow may enter fully armed.  
> **But they'll exit questioning where—and when—they fought.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
An **encrypted waveform woven into a metro map spiral**, its center marked with a falling packet glyph.

> **We do not jam.  
> We curate the silence between what was sent.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Floodstone Gray** `#7E868C` – Tunnel rust, signal fade  
- **Data Ochre** `#C9B872` – Encrypted codeflash  
- **Shadow Echo** `#2E3136` – Stealth pulse, audio void

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Vltava Ciphers are a **comms-disruptive insurgency** trained in underground warfare and acoustic subversion.

- **Voice commands looped mid-op to trigger false engagements**  
- **HUDs desync due to packet layering and GPS audio displacement**  
- **Subway lights and sounds simulate troop movement using acoustic AI**  
- **Operators may be baited by help signals from their own past recordings**

> You will not be overwhelmed.  
> **You will be overwritten.**
