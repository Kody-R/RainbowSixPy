# The Drowned Archive

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Sudan (Submerged signal ruins, Nile satellite vaults, relic-transmission floodplains)** – Operating from temple crypt uplinks, algae-caked relay stones, and waterlogged data bunkers

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Drowned Archive** is not lost.  
It was buried—by empire, river, and time.  
Now it speaks in floods, emits orders in ancient echo, and rewrites modern war with relics raised from the mud.

> “We raise what the river tried to erase.”

They wield broken satellites, sun-scorched targeting shrines, and flood-born weapons as data lures.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Flow Codex**, a doctrine of command written in erosion patterns, temple inscriptions, and orbital fragments.

- **Glyph Divers** – Combat scouts who retrieve command keys from submerged ruins  
- **Signal Curators** – Battlefield tacticians who rewrite GPS tags with temple-carved overlays  
- **Flood Priests** – Coordinators who trigger Nile-level surges to time ambushes and signal spikes

Their war begins with the current—and ends with the eclipse.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Drowned Archive uses **terrain-shifting flood traps, relic-encoded targeting, and semi-sunken ambushes**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Nile mudforts, flooded data halls, broken aqueduct command towers  
- **Style:** Ambush via current logic, signal inheritance, stealth ruin warfare  
- **Presence:** River-fed signal pits, sunken altars, reflection-coded ambush banks  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Use glyph-etched mirrors to misalign satellite-guided weapons**  
  - **Trap squads in rising pools tied to silt-pulse motion activators**  
  - **Mask operator heat signatures via underwater clay sigils**  
  - **Redirect recon drones through carved tunnel path reflectors**

> Rainbow will come for a fight.  
> **But the Archive already rewrote where it ends.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **submerged data tablet**, its surface glowing with orbital etchings and half-visible Nile glyphs.

> **We do not decode the past.  
> We live within it.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Silt Gold** `#BBA15A` – Memory buried  
- **Mud Black** `#2F2B26` – Flood veil  
- **Echo Blue** `#3E8493` – Signal drift

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Drowned Archive is a **relic-signal insurgency**, using **hydro-shifted battlefield control, reflection-coded targeting, and submerged command rerouting**.

- **Ops confused by GPS displacement during seasonal river bloom**  
- **HUDs flash glyphs from false signal sources during combat**  
- **Thermal ghosts rise from wet tunnels long after the ambush has passed**  
- **Drone trails diverted by sky-reflecting water glyphs**

> Rainbow won’t drown.  
> **They’ll be forgotten—until the water speaks again.**
