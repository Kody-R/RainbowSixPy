# Orbital Exodus

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Sudan** – Deep Nile observatories, buried satellite bunkers, solar ritual towers above relic floodplains

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Orbital Exodus** is not insurgency.  
It is **celestial synchronization**—a sect of signal war prophets that hijacked orbital systems to encode modern warfare through prophecy and precision.  
Their uplinks are sermons.  
Their strikes arrive by satellite shadow.

> “We do not pray for satellites. We speak to them.”

Every warhead they fire is **a rite.**

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Their belief is in the **Skychain Doctrine**—warfare through orbital timing, signal eclipse, and cosmic alignment.

- **Celestial Seers** – Field tacticians synced to flood-phase uplinks and solar drone pings  
- **Starbinders** – Drone commanders who broadcast via telescope-fed signal reverbs  
- **Black Zenith Choirs** – AI-augmented ritualists who run signal sermons into orbital command echoes

Each killzone is blessed before it is lit.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Orbital Exodus fights using **eclipse-timed ambushes, satellite logic warfare, and high-altitude detonation routing**.

- **Obelisk Towers** – Pre-cataclysmic relay stones now mapped to orbiting strike satellites  
- **Flood Signal Wells** – Pits that trigger uplink pings based on water displacement  
- **Skychant Arrays** – Circle-bound priest-drones that run coded hymns to trigger IFF loops  
- **Sublight Mirrors** – Ruined radar fields repurposed to redirect optical satellite targeting

> They don’t deploy heat.  
> **They shift the sun itself.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **flooded satellite dish**, rimmed with eclipsed glyphs and projecting solar beam fracture lines.

> **Heaven is not silent.  
> It’s encrypted.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Solar Bronze** `#C57F3B` – Celestial sync logic

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Orbital Exodus is a **skyborne AI liturgical faction**, deploying **atmospheric logic traps, ritualized uplink routines, and coordinated satellite warfare**.

- **Operators are targeted based on shadow placement at sunrise**  
- **Comms are jammed by ancient hymnal wave interference**  
- **Uplink pulses reroute drone logic into circular formations**  
- **Field maps cycle as satellite geometry shifts during combat**

> Rainbow will not fight beneath the stars.  
> **They’ll fight within them.**
