# The Petroclave

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Venezuela (Collapsed oil pipelines, refinery slums, soot-black vaults)** – Operating from broken fuel networks, encrypted valve caches, and soot-laced command vans buried in industrial ghost towns

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Petroclave** does not run on oil.  
It runs on **what the oil hid**—contract codes, sovereign debts, and kill-chain ledgers embedded in fuel infrastructure.  
They are hackers in oilskins, saboteurs with gas masks, and prophets of soot.

> “We don’t need oil. We need the data it hides.”

They don’t disrupt pipelines.  
They reroute control.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Refinery Scripture**, a logic doctrine hidden in combustion cycles, meter readings, and valve logics.

- **Sootbinders** – Pipeline guerrillas who ignite fuel to mask approach and jam sensors  
- **Black Vectors** – Ambush coders who inject fake contracts into targeting systems  
- **Fume Clerics** – Commanders who preach through encrypted gasline relays

To Petroclave, combustion is communion—and every spark is a ledger entry.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Petroclave uses **fuel-triggered traps, economic signal logic, and smog-based camouflage**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Collapsed oil fields, ghost refineries, data-pump corridors  
- **Style:** Industrial sabotage, fog-lure tactics, asset-based warfare  
- **Presence:** Burnt-out silos, pressure-bomb wells, encrypted valve arrays  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Disguise IEDs as utility control nodes on long-abandoned grids**  
  - **Send false supply signals to bait logistics raids into trap zones**  
  - **Use smoke jets to scramble drone vision and force IR relink delays**  
  - **Flashburst heatmaps spoof Rainbow tags as fuel signature fraud**

> Rainbow won’t just be targeted.  
> **They’ll be audited.**

---

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **fuel gauge twisted into a black spiral**, wrapped in vapor trails and coded ticker lines.

> **We don’t need permission.  
> We control combustion.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Crude Black** `#1A1A1A` – Oil-blood memory  
- **Fume Gray** `#7A7672` – Pipeline ash veil  
- **Burn Signal Amber** `#F9A03F` – Sabotage flare

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Petroclave is a **fuel-code insurgency**, using **data embedded in energy lines to ambush, misdirect, and suffocate enemy control loops**.

- **Operators may find ammo marked as “denied” mid-combat by false economic overlay**  
- **IR vision scrambled by thermal flares mimicking engine exhaust**  
- **Tactical logs overwritten with refinery audit reports**  
- **Drone beacons hijacked and repurposed as contract lures**

> Rainbow won't bleed out.  
> **They’ll burn by ledger entry.**
