# Childreen of Llaima

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Chile (Andean Volcanic Zone, Araucanía Region)** – Volcanic cave shrines, seismic field stations, and geothermal tunnels

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Childreen of Llaima** are not a rebellion.  
They are a **seismic prophecy**—a cult of geo-ritualists and tectonic saboteurs who worship the Earth’s fury.  
Their gospel is the tremor. Their shrine is the faultline. Their war is the quake.

> “Beneath stone sleeps wrath.”

Formed after a failed geothermal collapse operation, the cult now prepares **ritual quakes**, harnessing **gravitational disruptors and heat-pressure mines** to call forth their god: the World Splitter.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Cycle of Shear**, a belief that the planet must correct humanity’s balance by releasing stored tectonic pain.

- **Echo Runners** – Scouts trained to detect microquakes and plant sonic lures  
- **Faultbearers** – Engineers with modified mining rigs and fissure chargers  
- **Ash Masks** – Priests who chant seismic frequencies into the bedrock itself

The cult communicates via **subsonic pulses**, echoing tremors to awaken followers and blind sensors.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Childreen of Llaima weaponize **volcanic terrain, tremor tech, and religious terror**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Andes caverns, lava vents, crater bunkers  
- **Style:** Seismic ambushes, obsidian shrapnel traps, magma vent sabotage  
- **Presence:** Tectonic labs, scorched ruins, geothermal extraction zones  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Set faultline-shaped explosive arrays to fracture terrain**  
  - **Create false earthquake signals to mask troop movement**  
  - **Turn sulfur vents into biological hazard zones**  
  - **Use footfall-syncing rituals to trigger localized ground failures**

> You won’t hear the attack.  
> You’ll feel it rising under your feet.

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **cracked obsidian mask**, split by concentric tremor rings.  
It honors the Earth’s voice—and the silence that comes after the collapse.

> **The fault isn’t in the Earth.  
> It’s in us.**

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Children of Llaima are a **geoseismic insurgency** masked in ritual and ruin.

- **Can weaponize terrain with timed tectonic pulses**  
- **Use infrasound to disorient and scatter squads**  
- **Collapse paths behind them via core-placed implosion nodes**  
- **Deploy sulfuric smog to corrode airways and tech**

> Rainbow’s enemy here isn’t above ground.  
> **It’s the Earth itself.**
