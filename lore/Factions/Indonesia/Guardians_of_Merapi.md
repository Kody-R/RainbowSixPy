# Guardians of Merapi

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Indonesia (Mount Merapi, Central Java, Temple Networks)** – Volcanic ridgelines, hidden temple vaults, and geothermal conduit zones

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Guardians of Merapi** are flame-bonded zealots, forged in fire and legend.  
Part holy sect, part sabotage syndicate, they protect **volcanic temples and geothermal fault lines** from what they call “energy desecration.”  
They see magma not as destruction—but as prophecy.

> “The gods slumber beneath lava. We keep them fed.”

Their rites involve **ritual-triggered detonations**, ancient glyphs encoded for modern demolition, and sacrificial flame towers that double as defense pylons.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow **The Ember Path**—the belief that ancestral spirits live within volcanoes, and fire is the Earth’s divine tongue.

- **Firecallers** – Ritual engineers who chant ignition codes into volcanic vents  
- **Ashwardens** – Frontline protectors with obsidian armor and incendiary shock packs  
- **Glyphbearers** – Temple infiltrators who encode directional explosives into temple art

Their hierarchies mirror old temple structures, masked in ash and bonded in burn.
