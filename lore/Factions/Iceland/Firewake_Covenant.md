# The Firewake Covenant

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Iceland (Volcanic ridges, glacial caverns, geothermal silos)** – Hidden in basalt tunnels, ancient magma vents, and melted signal bunkers sealed by seismic shifts

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Firewake Covenant** is a lava-borne resistance.  
Forged from ashfall, exile, and molten fury—they fight not with industry, but with the Earth’s oldest weapon: pressure.

> “The ash remembers. So do we.”

They don't fear collapse.  
They orchestrate it—bringing down steel titans and fireproof dreams alike with magma-laced justice.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Cycle of Break and Boil**—a doctrine rooted in tectonic memory and elemental rage.

- **Cindershroud Engineers** – Deploy magma-adapted pressure bombs and forge-grafted thermal grenades  
- **Ashcallers** – Ambushers trained to vanish in infrared-masked ashclouds and glacial soot  
- **Tremor Priors** – Seismic scouts who ride quake spikes and collapse tunnels by echo flare

Each strike coincides with geothermal surges—their calendar is not time-based, it is pressure-born.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Firewake Covenant uses **heat-based guerrilla warfare, thermal denial traps, and seismic collapse zones**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Lava vents, glacial runoffs, ash-covered cliff passes  
- **Style:** Ambush, tremor-lure, volcanic sabotage  
- **Presence:** Melted radar stations, geothermal ruins, obsidian-walled crevasses  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Trigger pressure bomb networks beneath enemy outposts**  
  - **Use ashcloud canisters to blind IR drones and scramble LiDAR**  
  - **Collapse ice bridges and cliff access routes with ground-rigged fault displacers**  
  - **Lure armored units into soft crust zones that fracture under stress**

> They don’t set traps.  
> **They set eruptions.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **cracked basalt ring** encircling a molten core, bisected by a faultline-shaped waveform.

> **You built on frozen fire.  
> We remember where it sleeps.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Magma Black** `#2C2A26` – Burned basalt, deep fury  
- **Pyroclast Red** `#C43C3C` – Volcanic retaliation  
- **Steam Bone** `#E8E3D7` – Cracked glacier, residual life

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Firewake Covenant is a **seismothermal insurgency**, expert in using terrain collapse and heat shock to overwhelm or scatter modern forces.

- **Seismic traps cause uneven footing and collapse near geothermal wells**  
- **IR camouflage via ash-caked cloaks and vent steam fields**  
- **Ashburst bombs fry optics and saturate squad lungs in seconds**  
- **Lava-fractured terrain reroutes armor and traps infantry in thermally unstable kill zones**

> Rainbow will feel it first in the feet.  
> **Then in the breath. Then the silence.**
