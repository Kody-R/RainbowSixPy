# The Jade Signal

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Guatemala (Volcanic temple zones, jungle signal totems, obsidian comm crypts)** – Operating from carved code-pyramids, overgrown relay glyphs, and quartz-powered signal traps

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Jade Signal** doesn’t broadcast noise.  
It **activates memory**—engraved in stone, refracted through vines, and whispered across jungle pulse beacons.  
They are the inheritors of an encrypted faith built before the antenna.  
And now, it transmits again.

> “We carved the first code. You just forgot.”

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Lex Codex**, a glyph-script doctrine that encodes war through light angle, spatial rhythm, and ancient frequency logic.

- **Temple Lighters** – Glyph tacticians who activate mirror-path traps with solar triggers  
- **Stone Weavers** – Terrain specialists who map combat zones to celestial glyph alignments  
- **Pulse Callers** – Field agents who use resonance to call encoded support via quartz chimes

Each mission is pre-inscribed in stone, awaiting only the proper resonance.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Jade Signal uses **light-encoded combat zones, solar-triggered ambush, and jungle-acoustic command**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Cloud forest pyramid ruins, obsidian chamber echoes, mist-wrapped step altars  
- **Style:** Geometric entrapment, solar timing, light logic warfare  
- **Presence:** Carved jungle totems, volcanic glyph vaults, hidden beacon wells  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Trigger traps using sunbeam mirrors at specific time-of-day coordinates**  
  - **Use signal confusion glyphs to scramble IFF with temple reflection pulses**  
  - **Bury signal bombs in echo chambers that detonate with harmonic chant**  
  - **Direct operator paths via mapped temple resonance corridors**

> Rainbow won’t be lost.  
> **They’ll be overwritten.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **spiral glyph cut into jade stone**, with embedded quartz shards radiating harmonic pulse arcs.

> **Our code was first.  
> Our echo returns now.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Jade Green** `#00A86B` – Ancient clarity, encoded guidance  
- **Obsidian Black** `#1C1C1C` – Sacred signal tomb  
- **Quartz White** `#E5E3E0` – Echo purity, refracted broadcast

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Jade Signal is a **ritual tech insurgency**, using **geometry-based logic traps, light signal warfare, and harmonic command inversion**.

- **Squads redirected by mirrored glyph pathways mid-combat**  
- **Sunset-delay ambushes strike at astronomical junctions**  
- **Operators hear combat orders encrypted in ritual tones**  
- **IFF scrambled during eclipse reflection fields near pyramid altars**

> Rainbow will engage.  
> **But they’ll be stepping into a signal already cast.**
