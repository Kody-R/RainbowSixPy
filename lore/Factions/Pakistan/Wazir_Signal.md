# The Wazir Signal

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Pakistan (Waziristan highlands, tribal relay caves, signal-dead canyons)** – Operating from carved sanctuaries, drone-scrambled ravines, and biometric-shadow zones

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Wazir Signal** isn’t broadcast—it’s buried.  
An echo-hidden insurgency born from the ruins of telecom towers and decades of electronic warfare.  
They strike only when the comms go dark, and vanish before the waveform stabilizes.

> “We speak in silence. We kill in delay.”

No cell towers.  
No beacons.  
Only the memory of motion and the fire that follows.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They live by the **Lost Packet Codex**—a guide to fighting without detection, commanding without command.

- **Echo Diggers** – Sappers who mine acoustic relays and break IR fences  
- **Blackwave Scouts** – Operatives trained to track drones by heat ghost trails  
- **Packet Priors** – Field tacticians with neural sync masks who rotate IFF identities on command

They operate through silence pacts—no radio, no light, no trace.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Wazir Signal uses **signal vacuum warfare, delayed ambush tactics, and void-triggered attacks**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Cracked stone ridges, signal-drowned valleys, post-fiberoptic bunkers  
- **Style:** Comms suppression, bait-and-blind movement, ambush from acoustic shadows  
- **Presence:** Cave forts layered in passive sonar, buried relay bones  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Time-lagged mines that activate after target departure**  
  - **Deploy drone decoys with broken IFF IDs to lure gunfire**  
  - **Jam battlefield logs via analog pulse emitters disguised as tribal altars**  
  - **Use biometric confusion tags—dead ops wearing live-team vitals**

> You won’t know the fight happened.  
> **Until the mission review fails to render.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **broken waveform descending into silence**, its tail tapering into cracked obsidian.

> **No noise.  
> Just the aftermath.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Silence Black** `#191A1A` – Comms death, signal void  
- **Dust Veil** `#A69888` – Rigid stone, motionless strike  
- **Crimson Pulse** `#8F2E2E` – Echo-mapped retribution

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Wazir Signal is a **non-transmissive threat**, using **signal decay, misdirection, and precision delay traps**.

- **HUD logs delay enemy detection timestamps**  
- **Operators suffer tracking glitch when entering echo valleys**  
- **Drone feeds hijacked and looped into pre-strike silence gaps**  
- **Comms blackouts activated by sand-driven analog rotors hidden in ruins**

> Rainbow won’t lose the op.  
> **They’ll just wonder if it ever started.**
