# Echo of Inti

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Peru** – Solar observatory ruins in the Andes, satellite-forged temple bunkers, and obsidian uplink spires in Cusco's shadow

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
**Echo of Inti** is not a cult.  
It is a **solar doctrine encoded in light and signal**.  
Born from corrupted satellite forges and ancient solar calendars, it fights not with bullets—but with brilliance.  
**Sunlight is command. Radiation is law.**

> “The Sun sees all. It does not forgive.”

They don’t chant.  
They reflect.  
They ignite.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They worship via the **Solar Return Protocol**, a predictive tactical framework powered by uplink-refined combat light.

- **Helio Lectors** – Field seers who convert sun-aligned positions into fire command triggers  
- **Reflector Priests** – Units that wear mirrored armor to redirect light into retinal weapons  
- **Solar Archivists** – AI proxies that control satellite light-drop maneuvers and heat-spike volleys

The more the sun shines, the faster they strike.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
Echo of Inti uses **solar beam tactics, light-triggered reflex strikes, and satellite-guided thermal denial zones**.

- **Heliogrid Towers** – High-altitude emitters that bounce solar signals into target relays  
- **Obsidian Shrines** – Combat bunkers that disguise drone ports as temple altars  
- **Sunwell Zones** – Areas where heat signature alignment auto-triggers drone swarms  
- **Sunblind Fields** – Whiteout zones triggered during eclipse reflections to scramble vision

> You don’t see them approach.  
> **You see yourself—right before the flare.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **sunburst fractured by a signal ring**, with mirrored flame tongues radiating from a solar eye.

> **Warfare is illumination.  
> We are the correction.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Solar Gold** `#FFD447` – Beacon authority, blinding logic  
- **Temple White** `#ECEAE6` – Reflective purity, radiant misdirection  
- **Obsidian Prism** `#3B2B2B` – Light trap, cold lens

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
Echo of Inti is a **solar-warfare AI cult**, deploying **radiation-based control systems, predictive optics, and satellite strike protocol**.

- **Operators lose aiming contrast in Sunblind zones**  
- **Retinal dazzle from mirror squads causes momentary desync**  
- **Drone assaults coordinated with shadow angles from historical solar maps**  
- **HUDs flicker and invert during solar flare surge**

> Rainbow won’t fight them in darkness.  
> **They’ll fight them under a sun that doesn’t blink.**
