# The Quipu Fold

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Peru (Incan ruins, cloud forest glyph towers, echo-split temple zones)** – Operating from subterranean rope crypts, sightline-gated glyph corridors, and acoustic trap sanctuaries

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Quipu Fold** doesn’t write history.  
They **tie it in knots**.  
From jungle-strangled ruins, they move unseen, communicating through **woven war-code**, acoustic cues, and mirrored illusions passed down by spectral scouts.

> “We do not write history. We tangle it.”

They sabotage timelines, ambush within loops, and treat warfare as a script that must be unraveled—not obeyed.

---

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
They follow the **Tangle Rite**—a doctrine of **inversion, misalignment, and reflection** rooted in ancient quipu coding.

- **Linekeepers** – Glyph scouts who encode orders into quipu rope knots and visual node strings  
- **Twistcallers** – Trap-layers who tune temple acoustics to mislead echo direction  
- **Knot-Masked** – Jungle specters who strike from mirrored zones and vanish into cloudfall

They believe killing is not necessary—**confusing the memory of the fight is enough**.

⚔️ **Operations Profile:**  
The Quipu Fold uses **knot-script misdirection, visual decoys, and mirrored map warfare**.

- **Primary Terrain:** Fog valleys, temple rift paths, obsidian glyph chambers  
- **Style:** Echo-lure, line-of-sight camouflage, spectral ambush  
- **Presence:** Overgrown jungle lines, temple step-switches, cloudbank trap points  
- **Tactics:**  
  - **Deploy rope-based signal loops that invert squad movement orders**  
  - **Trigger mirrored vision fields inside ancient solar doorways**  
  - **Trap thermal vision by baiting with motion-knot glyphs over rock fissures**  
  - **Echo-delay bursts to dislocate comms by 3-4 seconds per corridor**

> Rainbow may win the battle.  
> **But they won’t remember how.**

🎖️ **Insignia Description:**  
A **coiled knot in mid-tangle**, suspended between dual mirrored glyphs and outlined by spectral threads.

> **We are not ghosts.  
> We are loops.**

🎨 **Faction Colors:**

- **Mist Gold** `#C2A35E` – Ancient rope, lost signal  
- **Obsidian Shadow** `#2B1F1F` – Temple depth, eye reflection  
- **Jungle Smoke** `#6A6F64` – Fog veil, step erasure

---

🗡️ **Threat Analysis:**  
The Quipu Fold is a **psycho-geographic misdirection cell**, disrupting squad cohesion, visual certainty, and timeline logic.

- **Field orders appear to arrive in reverse**  
- **Mirror fields reflect movement from adjacent tunnels**  
- **Communication may reference events before they occur**  
- **Jungle paths collapse into echo chambers where speech is reshuffled**

> Rainbow will fight.  
> **But they may return with someone else’s victory.**
