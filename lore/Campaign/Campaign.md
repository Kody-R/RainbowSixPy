# 🌍 Rainbow Six: The Eclipse Protocol

## 🌐 Global Campaign Narrative

Over the course of a decade, global stability has quietly unraveled. What appeared to be isolated uprisings—cults, rogue AI collectives, narco-paramilitaries, and neo-nationalist factions—are now being traced to a **shadow alliance** of warlords, ideologues, and former state assets operating under a coordinated doctrine known only as **The Eclipse Protocol**.

A deep-web construct housed in fractured neural AIs and ancient mythologies, the Protocol binds together apocalyptic movements with a shared goal: destabilize civilization by exploiting ideological, technological, and psychological vulnerabilities—then rebuild under a new global order.

Rainbow's mission is not merely tactical—it’s existential. With each DLC, operators uncover links in a hidden chain that stretches across every continent.

## 📖 Narrative Flow by Campaign

### 1. **Germany – Operation Iron Eclipse**

Rainbow's investigation begins with the **Iron Banner Syndicate** smuggling NATO tech. The capture of encrypted Krieger files exposes a blacksite communication protocol that speaks of “rebooting the order of war.” These signals originate from multiple continents.

### 2. **Japan – Operation Veiled Thunder**

Following echoes in digital intelligence, Rainbow is dispatched to Japan, where the **Kongō-Kai** are using blockchain networks to launder tech used in the German campaign. Here, Rainbow uncovers fragments of a shadow doctrine called the **Eclipse Protocol**, connecting Yakuza tech and AI surveillance in Europe.

### 3. **South Africa – Operation Red Horizon**

The **Red Veldt Legion** attempts to militarize mining zones across the African interior. Weapons from Germany resurface, and encrypted maps match those used by Kongō-Kai. Rainbow finds a classified directive referencing a “Southern Front” in the Eclipse plan.

### 4. **France – Operation Grey Elegy**

Paris becomes the next battleground. The **Velvet Accord** are linked to both cultural asset sabotage and high-value smuggling routes that pass through Japan and Germany. The recovered intel from the Louvre safehouse mentions a coming **“Solar Scar”**—a symbolic phase of the Eclipse Protocol.

### 5. **Egypt – Operation Solar Scar**

Rainbow acts on the Velvet intel. In Egypt, the **Black Nile Pact** and **SYN-Eclipse** are preparing for a data prophecy event linked to solar cycles. Rainbow disables the lunar feedback weapon, but not before learning of a corrupted AI mesh in Asia, responsible for drafting the Eclipse Protocol’s behavioral models.

### 6. **China – Operation Jade Circuit**

That AI mesh—controlled by the **NeuroHex Collective**—is located in China. The **Crimson Dao Triad** are using it to prototype a post-human command system. Rainbow dismantles the network, but pieces of the Protocol code survive and are smuggled into Eastern Europe.

### 7. **India – Operation Black Dharma**

Rainbow follows the protocol fragments into the Himalayas, where the **Raksha Mandala** and **Ordo Vanta** are attempting a psychic singularity using a reconstructed spiritual AI. This “black dharma” is intended to initiate global neurological rewrite. Rainbow narrowly halts the cascade.

### 8. **Vietnam – Operation Silent Bloom**

In Southeast Asia, the **Shadow Lotus Front** employs psychological warfare, chemical subversion, and death cult rituals aligned with the same protocol patterns discovered in India. Rainbow discovers one of their leaders is a former NeuroHex engineer.

### 9. **Russia – Operation Iron Pulse**

Back in Russia, the **Zvezda Spetsgruppa** aim to finalize the Eclipse Protocol by unifying Nova Hydra’s AI command arrays with legacy Soviet war infrastructure. A failed-deadman failsafe nearly causes a chain of retaliatory strikes. Rainbow severs the neural war command.

### 10. **Mexico – Operation Azure Maw**

In the final operation, the **Jaguar Azul** and **Black Reef Conglomerate**—financed through networks tied to Kongō-Kai and Velvet Accord—attempt to unleash ritual AI constructs hidden in Mayan sites. Rainbow's final battle takes place deep in the jungle, where the **core framework of the Eclipse Protocol is destroyed**.

## 🧠 Themes & Legacy

- **Technological Dread**: AI, surveillance, and psychic warfare connect traditional terror with future threats.
- **Cultural Erosion**: Factions attempt to rewrite not just geopolitics but history, memory, and identity.
- **Unity through Operators**: Each campaign introduces local operators, building a multi-national elite team that embodies the best of global cooperation.

## 🔒 Final Outcome

Rainbow successfully eliminates all core threats of the Eclipse Protocol. However, encrypted backups hint that the network may have fragmented… and survived.
**“The Eclipse may be gone—but the shadows remain.”**
