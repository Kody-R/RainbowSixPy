🎴 **Overview:**  
**The Velvet Accord** is a whisper behind the camera, a glance from the balcony, a smile that means your days are numbered.

Operating under a veil of **glamour, wealth, and celebrity mystique**, this secretive cabal of **media moguls**, **elite influencers**, and **espionage artists** moves through the world not with armies — but with **alliances, illusions, and assassinations**.

> The spotlight blinds.  
> The velvet curtain hides the blade.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
The Velvet Accord subscribes to the philosophy of **“Finesse over Force.”**  
In their world, perception is reality — and power is dressed in silk and sequins.

Core tenets include:

- **Influence through seduction**  
- **Control through charisma**  
- **Victory through spectacle**

Their inner circle is composed of enigmatic figureheads and personas:

- **King Vanta** – The masked maestro and puppetmaster of operations  
- **Echo Diva** – An information broker disguised as a pop icon  
- **Masked Performers** – Operatives hidden in plain sight, their faces changing with the role

Each faction member has a dual identity — one of fame, one of fear. Their loyalty is to the Accord's script, and every mission is staged like a performance.
