# Iron Banner Syndicate

🌍 **Region of Origin:**  
**Industrial Zones Worldwide** – Active in collapsing city cores, privatized war zones, and black-market logistics corridors

---

🎴 **Overview:**  
The **Iron Banner Syndicate** rose from the slag heaps of failed union revolts and dismantled weapons programs.  
Where governments saw ruins, they saw **infrastructure**. Where workers were discarded, they forged them into soldiers.

A **paramilitary black-market cartel**, the Syndicate operates deep in the guts of post-industrial landscapes — **running guns, hijacking tech**, and turning forgotten factories into **war-forges**.

> If it **explodes**, they’ve **built it**.  
> If it’s **missing**, they’ve already sold it — twice.

🧠 **Doctrine & Structure:**  
Operating under a culture of **“Fabrication over Federation”**, the Iron Banner rejects traditional nationhood in favor of **production-based sovereignty**.  
Their doctrine prizes:

- **Dominance through durability**  
- **Profit through preparedness**  
- **Control through capacity**

The Syndicate's structure reflects their roots in labor and logistics:

- **Smelter Guards** maintain frontline suppression and armored convoys  
- **Steel Ghosts** operate in shadows — conducting tech raids and demolition ops in urban ruins  
- **Hazmat Troopers** secure contaminated industrial zones, retrofitting toxins into tools of war

At the top sits the **Anvil Council** — an anonymous cabal of weapons engineers, ex-union bosses, and industrialists who issue encrypted directives through supply manifests and scrapyard code.
